summary = """
The Alabama Unified Judicial System serves three appellate courts through a well-designed
infrastructure with both a public website (judicial.alabama.gov) and a JSON API
(publicportal-api.alappeals.gov).

Key findings:
1. Existing scrapers are working and use the correct API
2. Opinions are freely available without login or payment
3. The API returns JSON data with HATEOAS-style navigation
4. robots.txt returns 404 (no restrictions found)
5. Oral argument recordings require purchase but docket info is free
6. No RSS feeds available for subscription

The existing opinion scrapers appear functional and up-to-date. No immediate changes needed
for opinion scraping. Potential future work could add oral argument docket scraping or
party/attorney data extraction.
