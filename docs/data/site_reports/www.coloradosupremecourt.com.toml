summary = """
IMPORTANT: The domain www.coloradosupremecourt.com REDIRECTS to www.coloradolegalregulation.com (Office of
Attorney Regulation Counsel), which handles attorney admissions, registration, discipline, and CLE. This is NOT
the court opinions website.

The actual Colorado Supreme Court website is at www.coloradojudicial.gov/supreme-court, and opinions are
published on a separate vLex-powered platform at research.coloradojudicial.gov.

The vLex platform (Colorado Case Law Search) provides:
- Searchable database of Supreme Court and Court of Appeals opinions
- JSON API for programmatic access
- Both PDF and HTML formats
- Recent opinions updated regularly (daily)
- Full-text search and advanced filtering
- Supreme Court opinions from 2010+
- Court of Appeals opinions from 1970+ (gap 1970-1975)

An existing scraper (juriscraper/opinions/united_states/state/colo.py) already scrapes this platform using
the JSON API at research.coloradojudicial.gov/search.json.
"""

priority = "low"
priority_reasoning = """
Low priority for new scraper development:
- Existing scraper already covers this court using the vLex API
- Domain www.coloradosupremecourt.com is misleading - redirects to attorney regulation, not opinions
- Current scraper was updated in 2024 to work with the new vLex platform
- No gaps in coverage that need addressing

The court_url in courts.toml should potentially be updated from www.coloradosupremecourt.com to either:
- www.coloradojudicial.gov/supreme-court (main court website), or
- research.coloradojudicial.gov (opinions platform)
"""

complexity = "low"
complexity_reasoning = """
Low complexity (already implemented):
- Modern JSON API makes scraping straightforward
- Existing scraper handles this well
- vLex platform provides consistent, structured data
- Good metadata extraction (docket numbers, citations, judges, summaries)
- Both Supreme Court and Court of Appeals use same platform

If building from scratch:
- Would require JavaScript rendering OR direct API access
- API is not officially documented but is accessible
- Rate limiting unknown but likely reasonable for court data
- Data format is consistent and well-structured
