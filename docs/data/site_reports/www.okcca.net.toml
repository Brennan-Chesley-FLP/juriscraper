summary = """
The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals maintains a WordPress site (www.okcca.net) that
provides public access to published opinions dating back to 1908. The site is well-organized
with year-based browsing and displays full opinion text. An existing scraper
(juriscraper.opinions.united_states.state.oklacrimapp) already covers this court by
scraping from the related www.oscn.net domain. The site also provides information about
upcoming oral arguments with Vimeo livestream links, email notifications for new opinions,
and links to unpublished opinions on OSCN. The site uses WordPress and jQuery, with mostly
static content that's accessible without complex JavaScript rendering. Case lookup functionality
redirects to www.oscn.net for docket searches.
"""

priority = "low"
priority_reasoning = """
Priority is LOW because:
1. An existing, functional scraper already covers this court (oklacrimapp.py)
2. The scraper uses the official OSCN source (www.oscn.net) which is likely more stable
   than the WordPress frontend
3. No major known issues with the existing scraper
4. Public access with no authentication barriers
5. The WordPress site is a presentation layer on top of the OSCN data

However, it may be worth noting:
- Oral arguments are available via Vimeo livestream (not currently scraped)
- Unpublished opinions are available on OSCN (coverage status unknown)
- The site has excellent historical coverage (1908-present)
"""

complexity = "simple"
complexity_reasoning = """
Complexity is SIMPLE because:
1. Public access, no authentication required
2. Static HTML content (WordPress site with jQuery)
3. Clean URL patterns (https://www.okcca.net/cases/{YEAR}/OK-CR-{NUMBER}/)
4. No captchas or significant rate limiting
5. Robots.txt allows scraping (only disallows /wp-admin/)
6. Existing scraper demonstrates straightforward implementation
7. Content is well-structured with consistent formatting

The only moderate complexity is handling ISO-8859-1 encoding and cleaning the HTML
(already solved in existing scraper).
