summary = """
Kansas Judicial Branch maintains an excellent public-facing website with comprehensive access to opinions and oral arguments. The site uses multiple subdomains for different services:

- Main site (www.kscourts.org): General information, navigation
- Decisions search (searchdro.kscourts.gov): Searchable database of Supreme Court and Court of Appeals decisions
- Public Access Portal (prodportal.kscourts.gov): Case docket search
- Attorney Directory (directory-kard.kscourts.gov): Searchable attorney database
- eFiling Portal (filer.kscourts.gov): For attorney eFiling

Opinions are available in PDF format with both published and unpublished decisions. The decisions search interface allows filtering by date range, court, publication status, and keyword search. The search returns up to 500 results for keyword searches, or date-range browsing is available.

Oral arguments are archived as YouTube videos back to 2019, organized by year and docket number. Live streaming is available during court sessions.

Existing scrapers (kan.py and kanctapp.py) use Selenium to scrape the decisions list page at searchdro.kscourts.gov/Data/decisionsList. Both scrapers are functional and appear to be well-maintained (created 2023-2025).

The site does not appear to have rate limiting or robots.txt restrictions. No captchas or authentication required for public content.
