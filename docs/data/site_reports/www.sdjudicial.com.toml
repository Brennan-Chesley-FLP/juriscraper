**CRITICAL FINDING: SSL Certificate Error**

The domain www.sdjudicial.com is inaccessible due to an SSL certificate error:
ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID

Both HTTPS and HTTP attempts fail with this certificate error, suggesting:
1. The site may have moved to a different domain
2. The SSL certificate is misconfigured or expired
3. The domain may be parked or repurposed

**Next Steps Required:**
1. Research the current official website for South Dakota Supreme Court
2. Common alternatives might be:
   - ujs.sd.gov (Unified Judicial System)
   - sdjudicial.gov (government TLD)
   - southdakota.gov/judicial
3. Check if an existing scraper exists that might have the correct URL
4. Update courts.toml with correct URL once identified

**Research Needed:**
Without web search access, I cannot determine the current official URL for the
South Dakota Supreme Court. The site may have migrated to a different domain,
possibly using the .gov TLD instead of .com.
