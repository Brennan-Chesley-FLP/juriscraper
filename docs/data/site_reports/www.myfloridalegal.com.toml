summary = """
The Florida Attorney General website provides comprehensive access to AG opinions through two databases:

1. **Modern Database** (https://www.myfloridalegal.com/ag-opinions):
   - 5,020 opinions from ~1982 to present (as of 2026-01-09)
   - Good search and filtering capabilities
   - Both HTML and PDF formats available
   - Paginated results (30 per page default, configurable)
   - Clean URL patterns: /node/{id} or /ag-opinions/{slug}

2. **Historical Database** (https://www.myfloridalegal.com/histago.nsf/opinions):
   - 16,962 opinions dating back to at least 1951
   - Searchable by keyword and year
   - Separate URL structure: /histago/*
   - May have data quality issues in older entries

Both databases are publicly accessible without authentication. The site runs on Drupal and uses static HTML rendering with minimal JavaScript requirements. Opinions include full text, issue dates, opinion numbers, and topics/subjects.

**Scraping Recommendations:**
- Start with modern database as it has cleaner data
- Historical database provides valuable backfile but may need data cleaning
- No rate limiting observed, but robots.txt should be respected
- PDF versions available via /print/pdf/node/{id} pattern
"""

priority = "medium"
priority_reasoning = "Attorney General opinions are valuable legal documents, but they are advisory opinions rather than binding case law. The site is scrapable with no major technical barriers. Medium priority because: (1) no existing scraper for flaag, (2) public access with good coverage back to 1951, (3) moderate legal importance (advisory vs binding), (4) well-structured modern interface."

complexity = "simple"
complexity_reasoning = "Static HTML pages with clear patterns, no authentication required, no JavaScript rendering needed for content access, standard pagination. The main complexity is handling two separate database systems (modern and historical) with different URL patterns."
