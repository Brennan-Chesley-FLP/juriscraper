# RESEARCH NOTES

[research_notes]
summary = """
The Connecticut Judicial Branch website (jud.ct.gov) provides comprehensive public access to
appellate court opinions and trial court dockets. The site uses custom-built systems with
static HTML for opinions and ASP.NET for case lookup.

EXISTING COVERAGE: Two scrapers exist for Connecticut Supreme Court and Appellate Court opinions,
scraping year-based ARO (Advance Release Opinion) archive pages. Scrapers were recently updated
(2023) and extract rich metadata including procedural history, syllabus, and judges from opinion text.
Scraping works from 2000 onwards with backscraping support.

DOCKET SYSTEM: Separate civil/family case lookup system (civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov) provides
searchable access to Superior Court civil, family, housing, and small claims cases. Searchable
by party name, docket number, attorney, and property address. Also includes short calendars,
court events, and legal notices.

ORAL ARGUMENTS: Civil and housing livestreams available through separate portal. Remote
proceedings information available but not currently scraped.

UNIQUE FEATURES:
- Subject-based opinion categorization through Law Library
- E-filing system (E-Services)
- Attorney/Firm Juris Number lookup system
- Foreclosure tracking system
- Multilingual interface support

RECOMMENDATION: Opinion coverage is excellent. Potential future work:
1. Docket scraper for civil/family cases (moderately complex ASP.NET system)
2. Oral argument/livestream scraper
3. Criminal case lookup (separate system not explored)
"""

priority = "low"
priority_reasoning = """
Low priority for new opinion scraper development because:
- Excellent existing coverage for appellate opinions
- Recently updated scrapers (2023)
- Public access, no technical barriers
- Comprehensive metadata extraction
- Backscraping support from 2000

Medium priority for docket scraping if that becomes a focus area.
"""

complexity = "simple"
complexity_reasoning = """
Opinion scraping: Simple - static HTML archives, predictable year-based URLs, no JavaScript required
Existing scrapers handle the complexity well.

Docket scraping: Moderate - ASP.NET ViewState management, form-based search, session handling required.
Multiple search entry points (party, docket, attorney, property address).

Oral argument scraping: Unknown complexity - would need deeper exploration of streaming infrastructure.
