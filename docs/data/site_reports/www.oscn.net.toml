summary = """
OSCN (Oklahoma State Courts Network) is a comprehensive, statewide judicial
information system providing public access to opinions, dockets, legal research
tools, and court information for all Oklahoma courts.

**Strengths:**
- Extensive historical coverage (back to 1890 for Supreme Court)
- Comprehensive docket search across all state courts
- Opinions available in both HTML and PDF
- Citation analysis tools (Citationizer)
- Oral argument videos (Supreme Court)
- No login or payment required
- Multiple search capabilities
- Email notification system for new opinions

**Challenges:**
- robots.txt contains Disallow: / which technically prohibits scraping
- JavaScript required for some features
- Multiple courts/databases on single domain
- Custom encoding (ISO-8859-1)
- Oral arguments only retained for ~1 year

**Scraping Recommendations:**
Existing scrapers successfully operate despite robots.txt restrictions.
Recommend:
1. Continue using existing opinion scrapers with respectful rate limiting
2. Consider adding oral arguments scraper (before videos expire)
3. Potential to add docket scraper given comprehensive search capabilities
4. Monitor for any enforcement of robots.txt restrictions
5. Consider reaching out to OSCN for explicit scraping permission

The site appears designed for public access with extensive search capabilities,
suggesting the robots.txt may be overly restrictive or primarily targeting
aggressive crawlers.
"""

priority = "low"

Priority is LOW for new scraper development because:
1. Existing scrapers already cover the four main opinion sources
2. robots.txt explicitly disallows automated access (legal/ethical concern)
3. Good existing coverage of opinions

However, MEDIUM priority for:
1. Adding oral arguments scraper (unique content, time-limited availability)
2. Potential enhancement to existing scrapers if they break

Complexity is MODERATE because:

**Simple aspects:**
- Public access, no login required
- Well-structured HTML
- Multiple existing reference implementations

**Moderate complexity:**
- JavaScript required for some features
- Custom character encoding (ISO-8859-1)
- Multiple courts/databases to handle
- robots.txt restrictions to consider

**For new scrapers:**
- Oral arguments: SIMPLE (direct video links, structured page)

# Additional recommendations
recommendations = """
1. **Maintain existing scrapers**: Continue operating existing opinion scrapers
   with respectful rate limiting and monitoring for any access issues.

2. **Oral arguments opportunity**: Consider adding oral arguments scraper since
   videos are unique content not available elsewhere and are time-limited.

3. **Seek permission**: Given robots.txt restrictions, recommend reaching out to
   webmaster@oscn.net to:
   - Confirm acceptable use of existing scrapers
   - Request permission for oral arguments scraping
   - Establish appropriate rate limits
   - Discuss any planned expansion

4. **Monitor for changes**: Watch for changes to robots.txt, site structure,
   or any access restrictions that might affect existing scrapers.

5. **Docket data**: The comprehensive docket search could be valuable but would
   require more complex scraping. Evaluate ROI given robots.txt concerns.

6. **Alternative approaches**: Consider whether RSS feeds or the email notification
   system (https://www.oscn.net/mailinglist/) could supplement or replace scraping
   for new opinions.
