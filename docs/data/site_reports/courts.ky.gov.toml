summary = """
Kentucky uses a sophisticated C-Track case management system (Thomson Reuters) for appellate courts.
The system provides excellent API access with well-structured JSON endpoints for opinions, dockets,
and documents. Existing scrapers (ky.py, kyctapp.py) are well-maintained and use the API effectively.

The system serves both the Kentucky Supreme Court and Court of Appeals with a unified interface.
67,137+ opinions are available publicly with PDFs downloadable. The API allows filtering by court,
date range, and other criteria. Most recently updated in 2024-2025.

No major issues identified. The existing scrapers appear to provide good coverage of appellate opinions.
Oral arguments are livestreamed but archive availability is unclear. Docket data is rich but not
currently being scraped.

API Endpoints Discovered:
- GET /api/api/v1/opinions/search - Opinion search with filters
- GET /api/api/v1/publicaccessdocuments?filter=parentCategory=docketentries,parentID={id} - Docket entries
- GET /api/api/v1/publicaccessdocuments/{id}/download - Document download
- GET /api/api/v1/userpermissions - User permissions
- GET /api/api/v1/staticlinks - Static links
- GET /api/api/v1/searches/types/{type}/fields - Search field metadata
"""

priority = "low"
priority_reasoning = """
Existing scrapers are well-maintained and functional. The system has good API access and is already
being scraped effectively. No immediate improvements needed unless:
1. Docket scraping is desired (currently only opinions are scraped)
2. Oral argument audio/video archives can be located
3. Lower court (trial court) data becomes available
"""

complexity = "moderate"
complexity_reasoning = """
The API is well-structured and documented through usage. However, it's a JavaScript SPA requiring
multiple API calls to fetch complete data (opinion metadata + document details). The existing
implementation handles this well with get_json() helper method. Published/unpublished status
requires parsing document text. Judge extraction requires regex parsing of disposition strings.
