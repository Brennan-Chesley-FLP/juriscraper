New York has one of the most complex court systems in the United States:
- 400+ individual courts across multiple levels
- Confusing nomenclature: "Supreme Court" is the TRIAL court, not the highest court
- Court of Appeals is the highest court (equivalent to other states' Supreme Courts)
- Multiple intermediate appellate courts (4 Appellate Divisions, multiple Appellate Terms)
- Extensive system of specialized courts (Family, Surrogate's, Court of Claims, Commercial Division)
- Town and village justice courts (~1,250 total, many served by this portal)

E-filing system (NYSCEF) is mandatory in many counties and case types:

[research_notes]
summary = """
www.nycourts.gov is the statewide portal for New York's Unified Court System, serving
400+ courts across all levels from the Court of Appeals down to town and village justice
courts.

**Key Findings:**
- Extensive opinion coverage at multiple levels (Court of Appeals, Appellate Divisions,
  Trial Courts, Commercial Division, Court of Claims)
- Multiple access points for opinions - not a single unified search interface
- E-Courts system (WebCivil) for case information and dockets
- NYSCEF for e-filing
- Attorney search database
- Court locator for 400+ courts
- Judges' directory
- No single comprehensive API or data feed
- Robots.txt disallows many reporter paths but allows general access
- No crawl delay specified

**System Architecture:**
The NY court system uses multiple distinct subsystems:
1. Decisions portals (varies by court level)
2. E-Courts/WebCivil (case information)
3. NYSCEF (e-filing)
4. E-Track (case tracking)
5. Attorney Services
6. Court Locator
7. Official Law Reporter system

Each subsystem has its own URL structure, authentication, and access patterns.

**Existing Scraper Coverage:**
Juriscraper already has scrapers for:
- NY Court of Appeals
- All 4 Appellate Divisions
- Some Appellate Terms

Trial court coverage may be limited or non-existent.
"""

priority = "medium"
priority_reasoning = """
Medium priority because:
- Existing scraper coverage for major appellate courts (Court of Appeals, Appellate Divisions)
- Trial court opinions may not be as comprehensively covered
- Complex multi-system architecture makes comprehensive scraping challenging
- Very important jurisdiction (largest state court system in US by volume)

Not high priority because:
- Major appellate courts already have scraper coverage
- Multiple subsystems would require multiple scraper implementations
- Complexity of 400+ courts makes comprehensive coverage impractical
"""

complexity = "complex"
complexity_reasoning = """
Highly complex implementation due to:
- 400+ individual courts with varying structures
- Multiple distinct subsystems (Decisions, E-Courts, NYSCEF, etc.)
- No unified API or data access method
- Different URL patterns and structures for different court levels
- Robots.txt restrictions on some reporter paths
- Some content requires authentication (e-filing, full dockets)
- Existing scrapers already cover major appellate courts
- Trial court scraping would require understanding E-Courts system
- Scale: comprehensive coverage would require dozens of individual scrapers

Recommendation: Focus on gaps in existing coverage (trial courts) rather than
duplicating existing appellate court scrapers.
"""
