summary = """
**Excellent site for scraping tribal court decisions**

The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Court website provides outstanding public access to court
decisions dating back to 2010. All decisions are published as PDFs organized by case type
(Appellate, Civil, Land, Probate, Traffic).

**Key Findings:**
1. All decisions are publicly accessible without login or payment
2. Well-organized decision lists by case type
3. Descriptive filenames include case numbers and dates
4. PDF documents hosted on CloudFront CDN
5. Good historical coverage (2010-2021 based on visible decisions)
6. No robots.txt restrictions on decision pages

**URL Patterns:**
- Decision list pages: https://www.srmt-nsn.gov/independent-officials/tribal-courts/decisions/{type}
  where {type} = appellate, civil, land, probate, traffic
- PDF documents:
  - https://dvc479a3doke3.cloudfront.net/_uploads/education/{filename}.pdf
  - https://www.srmt-nsn.gov/_uploads/site_files/{filename}.pdf

**Scraping Approach:**
1. Scrape each decision type page to extract PDF links
2. Parse filenames to extract case numbers and dates
3. Download PDFs for text extraction
4. Case numbers follow format: YY-TYPE-##### (e.g., 21-APP-00004, 19-CIV-00017)

**Additional Resources:**
- Digital Law Library at law.srmt-nsn.gov (separate domain, needs investigation)
- Court rules and forms available
- Judge information available

This is an excellent candidate for a new scraper - clean HTML structure, public access,
good historical data, and well-organized content.
"""

priority = "high"
priority_reasoning = """
High priority for scraper development because:
1. Excellent public access with no barriers
2. Well-structured, scrapable HTML pages
3. Good historical coverage (10+ years)
4. No existing scraper for this court
5. Important tribal court with unique jurisdiction
6. Clean, predictable URL patterns
7. PDF documents easily accessible

Only moderate complexity - primarily involves HTML parsing and PDF downloads.
"""

complexity = "moderate"
complexity_reasoning = """
Moderate complexity because:
1. Static HTML pages - no JavaScript rendering needed
2. Well-structured decision lists
3. Predictable URL patterns
4. No authentication or rate limiting apparent

Challenges:
1. Need to handle multiple decision types (5 categories)
2. PDF text extraction required
3. Some decisions span multiple related case numbers
4. Redacted versions may have different content
5. Older decisions may use different URL patterns

Overall: Straightforward scraping with standard HTML parsing and PDF handling.
