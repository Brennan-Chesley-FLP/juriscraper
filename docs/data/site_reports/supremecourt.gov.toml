The Supreme Court website (supremecourt.gov) provides comprehensive public access to opinions, oral arguments,
dockets, and case documents. The site is built on ASP.NET and does not require JavaScript for basic functionality.

Extensive existing scraper coverage exists:
- Slip opinions (scotus_slip.py)
- Opinions relating to orders (scotus_relating.py)
- In-chambers opinions (scotus_chambers.py)
- Oral arguments audio (scotus.py in oral_args)
- Docket reports (multiple scrapers in scotus/ directory)

The robots.txt file specifies a 1-second crawl delay and disallows /images/, /rss/, and /cdn/ paths.

Key features:
- Opinions organized by term year (2018-present easily accessible)
- Docket search functionality
- Oral argument transcripts and audio
- Orders of the Court
- Case documents including original jurisdiction records & briefs
- Calendar of argument days and conference days
- Electronic filing system

The site provides a table-based listing of opinions with columns for docket number, case name, justice/author,
and citation. Opinions are available as PDFs.
