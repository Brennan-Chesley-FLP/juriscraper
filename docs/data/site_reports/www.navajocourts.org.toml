**CRITICAL FINDING: DOMAIN NO LONGER ACCESSIBLE**

As of 2026-01-09, the domain www.navajocourts.org redirects to fridakahlofans.com,
a completely unrelated website (a Frida Kahlo fan blog in Indonesian language). This indicates that:

1. The domain registration may have lapsed
2. The domain was taken over by a third party
3. The Navajo Nation Courts have moved to a new domain

**Action Items:**
- Research alternate domains for Navajo Nation Courts
- Check if courts moved to a .gov domain or tribal.gov subdomain
- Search for current Navajo Nation judicial system website
- Check Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) for historical content
- Contact Navajo Nation government to determine current court website

**Historical Context:**
The Navajo Nation has three courts that were supposed to be covered by this domain:
- navajoctapp: Navajo Court of Appeals
- navajodistct: Navajo Nation District Court
- navajo: Navajo Nation Supreme Court

These courts may now be publishing opinions through a different online portal or may not have
an online presence for case law.
