summary = """
The www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov site is primarily an informational portal for the Maricopa County Superior Court system. The site includes:

1. General court information and resources
2. A docket search system (http://www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/docket/index.asp) for Civil, Criminal, Family, and Probate cases
3. Judicial biographies
4. Court forms and procedural information
5. Courthouse locations

**Key Finding - Arizona Tax Court**: The Arizona Tax Court URL listed in courts.toml (http://www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/SuperiorCourt/TaxCourt/) returns a 404 error. No dedicated Tax Court portal or opinions section was found during the research. The Tax Court may have been:
- Reorganized or integrated into the general Superior Court structure
- Moved to a different URL
- Discontinued or merged with another division

**Docket System**: While a docket search system exists, robots.txt explicitly disallows the /Docket/ path, indicating that automated scraping of dockets is not permitted by the site's robots policy.

**Opinions**: No public opinions portal was found for any Superior Court division, including the Tax Court. This site does not appear to host published court opinions.

**Recommendation**: Further investigation is needed to determine:
1. Whether the Arizona Tax Court still operates and where its opinions (if any) are published
2. Whether Tax Court decisions are published through Arizona's statewide court system (azcourts.gov) instead of the county level
3. Whether the court_id "ariztaxct" should be retired or its URL updated
