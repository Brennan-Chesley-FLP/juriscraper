Ohio Court of Claims (ohiocourtofclaims.gov) is primarily an informational website.
Published opinions are available through the Ohio Supreme Court's Reporter of Decisions
at www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/ - NOT on this website.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Old Domain Defunct**: www.cco.state.oh.us no longer works (connection refused).
   The current domain is ohiocourtofclaims.gov.

2. **Existing Coverage**: Working scraper (ohioctcl.py) uses supremecourt.ohio.gov
   with court_index = 13. No changes needed.

3. **Site Content**:
   - Court information and procedures
   - Electronic filing links (eFileOhio)
   - Case search via Tyler Tech portal (external)
   - Open Data portal with statistics
   - Crime Victims Compensation information

4. **Technical**:
   - WordPress-based with jQuery
   - accessiBe accessibility widget
   - 1-second crawl delay in robots.txt
   - Blocks AI training bots

5. **No Scraping Needed**:
   - Opinions already scraped from supremecourt.ohio.gov
   - Tyler Tech portal is a separate external system
   - This site is informational only

**Recommendations:**
- Update courts.toml court_url from defunct www.cco.state.oh.us to ohiocourtofclaims.gov
- No new scraper development needed
- Tyler Tech portal could be explored for docket scraping if desired
