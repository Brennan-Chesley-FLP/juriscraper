**Existing Scrapers:**

These scrapers may need review/updates based on any site changes.
"""

priority = "low"
priority_reasoning = "Existing scrapers already cover this court system (nc, ncctapp, ncbizct). Site has good public access with 36K+ opinions. Low priority because coverage already exists - focus should be on maintaining/updating existing scrapers rather than creating new ones."

complexity = "simple"
complexity_reasoning = "Well-structured Drupal site with clean patterns, good filtering, bulk downloads, and public access. However, existing scrapers mean no new scraper development needed. Complexity assessment is for reference if scrapers need updates."
