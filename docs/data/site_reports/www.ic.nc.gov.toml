summary = """
The North Carolina Industrial Commission website provides comprehensive access to workers'
compensation decisions through a searchable OpenText Content Server database (requires
public/public login) and direct PDF links for appellate court decisions. Coverage extends
back to 1994 for both Deputy Commissioner and Full Commission decisions.

The site is in a transitional state with some features (hearing calendars, master docket)
moved to a modern Salesforce Community portal while core decision databases remain on the
legacy OpenText system.

Key technical considerations:
1. OpenText database requires session-based authentication (public credentials)
2. Opinions are PDFs requiring parsing for structured data extraction
3. New portal features require JavaScript rendering
4. Search functionality is robust with full-text capability across databases
5. No bulk download option but comprehensive search makes incremental scraping feasible

Three types of opinions available:
- Deputy Commissioner decisions (trial level)
- Full Commission decisions (administrative appeals)
- NC Supreme Court & Court of Appeals decisions (judicial review)

Docket/calendar information available but hearing-level detail limited.

# High priority - good public access, comprehensive historical coverage, no existing scraper
priority = "high"

High priority because:
1. No existing scraper for this court (ncworkcompcom)
2. Comprehensive historical coverage (since 1994)
3. Public access with simple authentication (public/public)
4. Workers' compensation decisions are important for labor law research
5. Well-organized content with multiple access points
6. Active tribunal with ongoing updates
"""

# Moderate complexity due to authentication and PDF parsing
complexity = "moderate"
complexity_reasoning = """
Moderate complexity:
- Requires handling OpenText Content Server authentication
- PDF parsing needed for full text extraction
- Multiple data sources (legacy pages + new portal)
- JavaScript rendering needed for some features (hearing calendars, master docket)
- Search interface navigation for opinion discovery
- No API, requires screen scraping and form interaction

Not simple because of authentication requirement and dual platform architecture.
Not complex because authentication is publicly documented and opinions are well-organized.
