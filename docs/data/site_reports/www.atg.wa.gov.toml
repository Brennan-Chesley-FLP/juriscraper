notes = """
AG opinions are not binding law but are given "great respect" and "great weight" by courts.
They are formal legal opinions issued in response to requests from designated public officials
(legislators, statewide elected officials, state agency heads, county prosecutors).

Formal opinions are distinguished from informal opinions (letters). Only formal opinions
represent the official view of the Attorney General.

The site maintains two separate collections for 1970-1982:
- AGO (Attorney General Opinions) - formal opinions
- AGLO (Attorney General Letter Opinions) - informal opinions

summary = """
The Washington Attorney General's Office website provides comprehensive access to formal
AG opinions dating back to 1949. The site is built on Drupal CMS and works without JavaScript.

Key findings:
- Opinions are well-organized by year (1949-present) and by topic
- Full text available in HTML format (no PDF required)
- Clean, accessible HTML structure suitable for scraping
- Standard Drupal robots.txt with reasonable restrictions
- No authentication, captchas, or paywalls
- RSS feed available for news releases
- Email subscription available for new opinion notifications

URL patterns:
- Year index: /ago-opinions/year/{YYYY}
- Individual opinions: /ago-opinions/{slug}
- Topic browse: /ago-opinion/glossary

The site distinguishes between formal opinions (representing the AG's official position)
and informal opinions (letter responses). For juriscraper purposes, formal opinions are
the primary target.

Technical simplicity and public accessibility make this an ideal candidate for scraping.

Medium priority because:
- Public access, no technical barriers
- Clean HTML structure, simple to scrape
- Historical depth (1949-present)
- Unique legal resource (AG opinions vs court opinions)
- No existing scraper

Not high priority because:
- AG opinions are advisory, not binding precedent
- Lower volume than court opinions (3 opinions in 2025 YTD)
- Specialized legal audience
"""

Simple scraping complexity:
- Static HTML, no JavaScript required
- Clean URL structure
- Standard pagination by year
- No authentication or rate limiting
- Drupal-based with predictable HTML patterns
- robots.txt allows scraping of opinion content
