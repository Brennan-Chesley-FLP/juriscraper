summary = """
The Idaho Supreme Court website (isc.idaho.gov) provides comprehensive public access to court opinions
for both the Idaho Supreme Court and Idaho Court of Appeals. The site uses a Drupal CMS with static
HTML tables listing opinions, making it straightforward to scrape.

EXISTING COVERAGE: Five scrapers already exist covering all opinion types (civil, criminal, published,
unpublished) for both courts. The scrapers were recently updated in 2024-2025 and use the OpinionSiteLinear
framework. They extract case metadata (date, docket, name, URL) and some scrapers extract lower court
information from opinion text.

DOCKET SYSTEM: Separate Tyler Technologies Odyssey portal (mycourts.idaho.gov) provides access to trial
court dockets and case records statewide. This would require separate scraper development and may have
access restrictions.

ORAL ARGUMENTS: Video archives of hearings are available but not currently scraped. Could be valuable
addition for audio/video content.

RECOMMENDATION: The opinion scraping is well-covered. Potential future work includes:
1. Oral argument video scraper
2. iCourt Portal docket scraper (more complex, Tyler Odyssey platform)
3. Monitoring existing scrapers for any site changes
"""

priority = "low"

Low priority for new scraper development because:
- Excellent existing coverage for all opinion types
- Recently updated scrapers (2024-2025)
- Public access, no technical barriers
- No known issues with existing scrapers

If prioritizing new work, oral argument videos would be the highest value addition.

Opinion scraping: Simple - static HTML tables, no JavaScript required, no authentication
Oral argument scraping: Moderate - would need to handle video content and potentially streaming
Docket scraping: Moderate to Complex - Tyler Odyssey platform, may have access controls,
sealed records handling required per court rules
