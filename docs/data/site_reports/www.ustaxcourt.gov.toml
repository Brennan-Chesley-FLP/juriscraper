The U.S. Tax Court is an Article I federal court with nationwide jurisdiction to resolve disputes between taxpayers and the IRS.

The court uses the DAWSON (not PACER) electronic filing and case management system.

Blue-Green Deployment: The API switches between 'public-api-blue' and 'public-api-green' subdomains for zero-downtime deployments. The existing scraper handles this by testing which endpoint is active.

Rate Limiting: API enforces 15 requests per 60 second window per IP address. The existing scraper includes 61-second sleep intervals during backscraping to avoid rate limits.

Opinion Types:
- T.C. Opinion: Published opinions (precedential)
- Memorandum Opinion: Unpublished (non-precedential)
- Summary Opinion: For small tax cases (under $50,000)
- Bench Opinion (Order of Service of Transcript): Oral decisions transcribed

Case Types: Multiple docket suffixes indicate case type (e.g., L for lien, S for small case, W for whistleblower)

Search Limitations: Opinion search returns maximum of 5,000 results. API returns 100 results or less per request during backscraping.

The U.S. Tax Court has an excellent modern website with the DAWSON case management system providing comprehensive public access to opinions, dockets, and case information since May 1, 1986.

**Existing Scraper**: A working scraper already exists at `juriscraper.opinions.united_states.federal_special.tax` that uses the public API endpoint. The scraper:
- Uses the opinion-search API with date range queries
- Handles blue-green deployment switching
- Includes rate limiting mitigation (61-second sleep between backscrape requests)
- Fetches PDF URLs via docket entry ID
- Supports backscraping with 10-day intervals

**API Endpoints Discovered**:
- `GET /public-api/opinion-search` - Search opinions with filters
- `GET /public-api/{docketNumber}/{docketEntryId}/public-document-download-url` - Get PDF URL
- `GET /public-api/todays-opinions` - Today's filed opinions
- `GET /public-api/maintenance-mode` - System status check
- `GET /system/feature-flag/` - Feature flags

**Technical Details**:
- React-based SPA requiring JavaScript
- API base URL switches between public-api-blue and public-api-green subdomains
- PDFs served from AWS S3 with signed URLs (120-second expiration)
- Rate limit: 15 requests per 60 seconds per IP
- Search limited to 5,000 results maximum
- No public authentication required for search and opinion access

**Content Quality**:
- Comprehensive coverage from May 1, 1986 onward
- Rich metadata: case title, judge, filing date, docket number, opinion type, page count
- Multiple opinion types properly categorized
- Advanced search with keyword support (exact match "", AND +, OR |)
- Judge filtering (70+ judges in dropdown)
- Trial session calendar available

**Recommended Actions**:
- Existing scraper is functional and uses the API correctly
- No urgent updates needed
- Consider adding Order search capability (separate API endpoint for orders)
- Consider adding case/docket detail scraping (currently only opinions)
