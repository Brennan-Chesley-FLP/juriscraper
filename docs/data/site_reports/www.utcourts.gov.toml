[research_notes]
summary = """
Utah Courts provides comprehensive public access to appellate court opinions and oral arguments.
The site has existing scrapers for both Supreme Court and Court of Appeals opinions that work well.
The opinions portal uses simple HTML pages with clear structure - no JavaScript required.
Oral arguments are available as streaming audio archives going back to 2004.

The Xchange system provides access to trial court dockets and documents, but requires a free account
and charges for document downloads. This would require authentication to scrape effectively.

Key findings:
- Opinions: Well-structured HTML pages with PDF links, existing scrapers working
- Oral arguments: Available from 2004-2025, organized by month, no existing scraper
- Dockets: Behind authentication wall (Xchange), but free signup
- robots.txt blocks direct PDF access but allows HTML pages
- RSS feed available for new opinions
