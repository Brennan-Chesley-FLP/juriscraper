summary = """
The Florida 6th DCA website is a modern Next.js application with a GraphQL and REST API backend.
The site uses the shared Florida Courts media infrastructure (flcourts-media.flcourts.gov) that
serves all Florida District Courts of Appeal.

Key findings:
- Opinions API: https://flcourts-media.flcourts.gov/_search/opinions/ with filtering by type, date, scope
- GraphQL API: https://flcourts-media.flcourts.gov/graphql for general content
- REST API: https://flcourts-media.flcourts.gov/api/ for structured data
- Document downloads: Direct PDF links via /content/download/ endpoints
- Oral arguments: Available via YouTube with live streaming capability
- External docket system: ACIS (https://acis.flcourts.gov) - shared across Florida courts

The existing scraper (juriscraper/opinions/united_states/state/fladistctapp_6.py) correctly targets
this court using the shared Florida scraper infrastructure with scopes="sixth_district_court_of_appeal"
and site_access="6dca".

Note: robots.txt explicitly disallows general crawling but permits major search engines. This may
impact scraping permissions.
"""

priority = "medium"
priority_reasoning = "Existing scraper is in place and working. The API-based approach is reliable. However, robots.txt restrictions and the fact that the scraper already exists means this is lower priority for new development. May need monitoring for API changes or to verify continued functionality."

complexity = "moderate"
complexity_reasoning = "The site uses JavaScript/React and requires API calls rather than simple HTML parsing. However, the API is relatively straightforward JSON with clear endpoints. The existing scraper demonstrates this is achievable with the shared Florida infrastructure."

blockers = ["robots.txt disallows general crawling (though existing scraper may have worked around this or have special permissions)"]
