summary = """
Cherokee Nation Courts website provides excellent access to Supreme Court opinions dating back to 1975.
All Supreme Court opinions are available as PDF documents organized by year ranges. The site uses DNN CMS
for the main website. District Court case information is available through a Tyler Technologies portal that
requires reCAPTCHA verification but no login.

Main content available:
1. Supreme Court opinions (1975-present) - well-organized, complete historical coverage
2. Administrative orders from Supreme Court
3. District Court docket search via Tyler portal (with reCAPTCHA)
4. Court rules and procedures
5. Judge and justice information

The Supreme Court opinion collection is the primary scraping target. Opinions are consistently formatted
PDFs with clear URL patterns in the /Portals/cherokeecourts/Documents/ directory.
"""

priority = "medium"
priority_reasoning = """
Medium priority for these reasons:
- Good public access to Supreme Court opinions with complete historical coverage
- Important tribal court covering significant jurisdiction in Oklahoma
- No existing scraper for Cherokee Nation courts
- Opinions are valuable for tribal law research and McGirt-related cases
- Static PDF links make scraping feasible without JavaScript rendering

Not high priority because:
- Relatively smaller volume compared to state appellate courts
- District Court portal has reCAPTCHA barrier
- Tribal court system has more limited general applicability
"""

complexity = "moderate"
complexity_reasoning = """
Moderate complexity:
- Supreme Court opinions: Simple - static HTML pages with PDF links, no authentication
- Opinion organization by year ranges requires multiple page scrapes
- PDF documents are straightforward to download
- Tyler portal for District Court requires handling reCAPTCHA (higher complexity if dockets are needed)
- No API available
- JavaScript not strictly required for Supreme Court opinions but used by site
- Well-structured URLs make pagination and discovery manageable
