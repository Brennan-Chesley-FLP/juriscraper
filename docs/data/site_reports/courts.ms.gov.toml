summary = """
The courts.ms.gov site provides excellent public access to Mississippi Supreme Court and Court of Appeals
opinions dating back to 1996. Opinions are organized by Hand Down Lists (publication dates) and available
as PDFs with metadata including case numbers, parties, lower court information, and disposition.

The site uses a custom POST-based API architecture for retrieving opinion data. Existing scrapers already
cover opinion extraction for both courts. Oral arguments are available via Vimeo webcasts with archives
since October 2014.

Trial court dockets are available through the MEC (Mississippi Electronic Courts) system, which requires
registration. The site has a robots.txt that allows scraping of opinion content while protecting internal
systems.

Key technical note: The site requires JavaScript and uses jQuery. A reCAPTCHA is present but doesn't
appear to block normal browsing. Bulk downloads are available as ZIP files containing WordPerfect documents.
"""

priority = "low"
priority_reasoning = """
Existing scrapers already provide good coverage of opinions from both the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals.
The scrapers use the discovered API endpoints effectively. Oral arguments are not currently being scraped but
are available via Vimeo. Trial court dockets require MEC registration which may not be worth the effort for
public data collection.
"""

complexity = "moderate"
complexity_reasoning = """
The existing scrapers demonstrate that the API approach works well. However:
- Requires JavaScript rendering
- Uses POST-based API calls rather than simple GET requests
- Has reCAPTCHA present (though not actively blocking)
- Trial court access requires registration
- Oral arguments would require Vimeo integration
