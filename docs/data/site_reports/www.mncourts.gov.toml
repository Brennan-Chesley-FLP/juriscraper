Minnesota provides excellent public access to court records through a well-organized statewide system.
Published opinions are freely available through multiple channels with daily updates at 10:00 AM.
Existing scrapers successfully use the Minnesota State Law Library search interface for opinion data.

Key findings:
1. Opinions: Well covered by existing scrapers using Law Library search API
2. Oral Arguments: Available on YouTube but no existing scraper
3. Dockets: Available through MCRO (district) and P-MACS (appellate) systems
4. Infrastructure: Clean, modern website with good public access features
5. Documentation: Excellent self-help resources and clear navigation

The state provides multiple access points (web, email notifications, courthouse terminals) and
maintains a comprehensive Law Library archive with advanced search capabilities. The system is
designed for both public and attorney access with separate portals as needed.

Opinions are already well-covered by existing scrapers using the Law Library search interface.
Potential improvements include:
1. Adding oral argument scraper for YouTube channel
2. Exploring MCRO/P-MACS for docket data

would be nice-to-have rather than critical.

The existing scraper architecture is clean and the Law Library interface provides structured data.
