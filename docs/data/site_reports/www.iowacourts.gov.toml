summary = """
The Iowa Judicial Branch website (www.iowacourts.gov) provides good public access
to Supreme Court and Court of Appeals opinions going back to at least 2017, with
archived opinions available for earlier years. The site uses static HTML with
pagination for recent opinions and has a clear, browseable structure.

Existing scrapers already cover opinion scraping for both courts. The scrapers
handle pagination and archive pages correctly.

Key opportunities for improvement:
1. Oral arguments are available as YouTube videos but are not currently scraped
2. Briefs (appellant, appellee, reply) are available as PDFs but not currently scraped
3. The full case search system (ESAWebApp) may provide additional docket data

The site is well-structured, publicly accessible, and respectful of robots.txt
with a 30-second crawl delay. Documents are primarily in PDF format.

Medium priority because:
- Existing scrapers already cover opinions successfully
- Main opportunity is oral arguments (YouTube videos) and briefs (PDFs)
- No major blockers or broken existing coverage
- Site is well-structured and publicly accessible
- Oral arguments would be valuable addition but opinions are already covered
"""

complexity = "simple"
complexity_reasoning = """
Simple complexity because:
- Static HTML with no JavaScript requirements
- Clear URL patterns and structure
- Existing working scrapers demonstrate the approach
- Standard PDF documents
- No authentication or captchas
- Pagination is straightforward with "Next" links
