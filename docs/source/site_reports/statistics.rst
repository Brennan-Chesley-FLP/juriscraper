Site Research Statistics
========================

This page provides comprehensive statistics about court website research
for **state courts** (non-PACER sites). These statistics are automatically
generated from the site research reports.

Statistics are presented at two levels:

- **Domain level**: Unique court website domains (e.g., ``courts.ca.gov``)
- **Court level**: Individual courts served by those domains (multiple courts
  often share the same domain)
