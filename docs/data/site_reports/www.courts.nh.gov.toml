summary = """
The New Hampshire Judicial Branch website provides public access to Supreme Court
opinions dating back to 2002. The site uses an undocumented JSON API that requires
JavaScript and specific query parameters including year-specific subcategory IDs.

Existing scrapers (nh_p.py and nh_u.py) cover published and unpublished Supreme
Court opinions using the API, but require annual maintenance to add new year filters.

The site also provides oral argument recordings (audio/video) with a published
calendar, but no scraper currently exists for this content.

Superior Court opinions were not located during this research session and may
require additional investigation.

The API structure is:
- Base URL: https://www.courts.nh.gov/content/api/documents
- Query parameters: iterate_nodes, q (filter), sort, filter_mode, type, page, size
- Each year requires specific field_document_subcategory or field_tags values
- Responses are paginated JSON with case metadata and PDF URLs

- Public access with no major barriers
