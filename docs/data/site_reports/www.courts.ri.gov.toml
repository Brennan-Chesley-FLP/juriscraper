summary = """
Rhode Island Judiciary maintains a comprehensive SharePoint-based website serving all state courts. The existing scraper for the Supreme Court (ri.py) successfully uses the SharePoint API to retrieve opinions and orders. The same API pattern could be extended to cover Superior Court decisions.

The site has a separate public portal (publicportal.courts.ri.gov) powered by Tyler Technologies Odyssey that provides case search and hearing search functionality, but it requires reCAPTCHA verification which limits automated access.

Opinion data is well-structured with metadata including:
- Case titles (RIJLongTitleOWSMTXT)
- Case numbers (RIJLongNumberOWSMTXT)
- Dates (RIJDateOWSDATE)
- Case summaries (RIJCaseSummaryOWSMTXT)
- Court type (RIJCourt)
- Document type (ContentType)

The SharePoint API returns JSON responses that can be parsed to extract all necessary metadata and PDF URLs.

# Recommended priority for building a scraper

priority_reasoning = "Supreme Court scraper already exists and works well. Superior Court could be added using the same API pattern.

Extending to Superior Court would require minimal changes - primarily adjusting the search filters and court identifier. The API provides structured JSON responses with all necessary metadata."
