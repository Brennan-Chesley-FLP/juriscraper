The Supreme Court of Georgia website is a well-organized WordPress site with excellent public access to opinions and oral arguments.

**Opinions**: Available as PDF files from 2017-present, organized by year with monthly groupings. Each opinion listing includes docket number(s), case name, and date. The existing juriscraper (ga.py) successfully scrapes this content.

**Oral Arguments**: Video recordings with transcripts available through embedded video player. Archives go back to at least December 2024, organized by hearing date. Each oral argument page shows multiple cases heard that day with individual video embeds.

**Dockets**: Case search system available via embedded iframe application covering last 5 years. Searchable by case number and party name.

**Site Structure**: Static HTML with minimal JavaScript requirements. No authentication barriers. robots.txt only blocks WordPress admin paths.

**Existing Coverage**: The ga.py scraper successfully handles opinions. No oral argument or docket scrapers exist yet.
