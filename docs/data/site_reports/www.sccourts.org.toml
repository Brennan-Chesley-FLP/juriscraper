summary = """
South Carolina operates a comprehensive statewide judicial website with excellent public access to opinions, dockets, and court information. Existing scrapers cover Supreme Court and Court of Appeals opinions (both published and unpublished) dating back to 2000.

Key findings:
1. Opinions: Well-organized by court and date, with both published and unpublished opinions available. PDFs for recent opinions, HTML for pre-2012.
2. Oral Arguments: Video archive available but not currently scraped. Potential opportunity for expansion.
3. Dockets: Multiple search portals available (trial courts, appellate courts, family court) but not currently scraped.
4. Search: Robust search capabilities with multiple filter options.
5. robots.txt: Highly restrictive with Disallow: / for general user-agents, but existing scrapers appear to work fine.
6. No API: All data access is via HTML scraping.

The existing scrapers are well-maintained and recently updated (2024-09). They use the OpinionSiteLinear base class and support backscaping. No major issues noted.

Court structure: SC Supreme Court (sc), SC Court of Appeals (scctapp), and Common Pleas Court (scctcompl) all share this portal.
