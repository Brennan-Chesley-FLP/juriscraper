Nevada courts use a modern multi-subdomain architecture with a clean JSON API for
advance opinions and oral arguments. The existing scraper already uses the API
effectively. The main site at nvcourts.gov serves as a portal, while
publicaccess.nvsupremecourt.us provides the API and caseinfo.nvsupremecourt.us
provides the C-Track case management system.

The API requires an API key and referrer header but is otherwise straightforward.
Opinion PDFs are not directly linked in the API - they must be retrieved by
searching the case info system.

Note: The task referenced www.nevadajudiciary.us which does not exist. The correct
domain is nvcourts.gov.
