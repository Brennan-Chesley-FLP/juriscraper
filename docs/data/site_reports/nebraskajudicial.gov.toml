summary = """
The Nebraska Judicial Branch website (nebraskajudicial.gov) provides comprehensive access to Supreme Court and Court of Appeals opinions through an ePublication system hosted at nebraska.gov/apps-courts-epub/.

Key findings:
1. **Domain Change**: Site has transitioned from supremecourt.ne.gov to nebraskajudicial.gov (redirects in place)
2. **ePublication System**: Robust opinion library system with PDF downloads, organized by volume
3. **Release Schedule**: Opinions released Fridays (Supreme Court) and Tuesdays (Court of Appeals) at 8am
4. **Historical Coverage**: Extensive historical archive going back many years
5. **Oral Arguments**: Both audio and video available, uploaded within 24 hours
6. **API Potential**: The ePublication system appears to use structured URLs with docId parameters that could potentially be scraped systematically
7. **Existing Scrapers**: Both neb.py and nebctapp.py scrapers exist and appear functional, scraping from the HTML pages

The existing scrapers work by parsing the HTML tables on the opinions pages. There may be an opportunity to improve scraping by using the ePublication API endpoints more directly, though the current approach appears to be working.
