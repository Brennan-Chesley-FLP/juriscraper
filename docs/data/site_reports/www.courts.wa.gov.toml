Washington State Courts operates a well-structured, publicly accessible website for court opinions.
The site provides:
- Supreme Court published opinions (2013-present)
- Court of Appeals published, unpublished, and "published in part" opinions (2013-present)
- Search and browse functionality
- RSS feeds and email notifications
- PDF downloads for all opinions

Existing juriscraper coverage includes all three court types (Supreme Court, Court of Appeals published, Court of Appeals unpublished) and appears to be working correctly with current site structure.

The site uses ColdFusion (.cfm URLs) and serves static HTML that does not require JavaScript.
No undocumented APIs were discovered during research.

Docket access is handled through separate systems (Odyssey Portal, JIS Link) which may warrant separate research.

Existing scrapers are in place and functional. The site structure appears stable and well-maintained.
Priority is low because current coverage is good. Potential improvements:
1. Add scraper for Superior Court if opinions are available
2. Research oral arguments availability
