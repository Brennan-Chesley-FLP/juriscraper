- Only some Court of Appeal opinions are certified for publication
- Unpublished opinions generally cannot be cited (Rule 8.1115)
- Both types are public records and available on the site

Two separate systems:
1. www.courts.ca.gov - Main portal for slip opinions and general information
2. appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov - Case information system for docket searches

summary = """
California operates a sophisticated dual-portal system for appellate court information:

1. Main Portal (www.courts.ca.gov):
   - Drupal-based, minimal JavaScript requirements
   - Slip opinions posted daily (Supreme Court: M/Th 10am, Appeals: throughout day)
   - 120-day window for recent opinions, then archived to Case Information System
   - PDF and HTML formats available
   - Clear filtering by court/district, case number, title
   - Partnership with LexisNexis for historical Official Reports (1850-present)

2. Case Information System (appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov):
   - Legacy ColdFusion application
   - Comprehensive docket search by case number, party, attorney, caption
   - Hourly updates during business day
   - Email notification system for case activity
   - Calendar function for upcoming arguments

Existing scrapers cover all courts and districts. The scrapers target the opinions listings
at www.courts.ca.gov/cms/opinions.htm with court-specific parameters.

Strengths:
- Public access, no authentication required
- Excellent historical coverage (1850-present)
- Well-structured HTML, easy to parse
- Multiple access points (direct URLs, search, browse)
- Reliable daily updates
- robots.txt permits crawling

Weaknesses:
- Two separate systems require different approaches
- Slip opinions only kept 120 days on main site (then must use Case Info System)
- No documented API
- Unpublished opinions have citation restrictions (legal, not technical)
