Louisiana AG opinions are advisory legal counsel to state governmental entities,
not binding court decisions. They can be requested only by:
- Governor
- State legislators
- State departments and agencies
- District attorneys
- Local governing bodies and their officers
- Certain local officials
- Private individuals (only on dual officeholding or dual employment matters)

Opinions can be revised due to court rulings or legislative changes.

summary = """
The Louisiana AG website provides access to Attorney General opinions through a
search interface. The site uses JavaScript and has a POST API endpoint at
/Opinion/Search. The search interface allows filtering by text and date range.

Key findings:
- No robots.txt file present (defaults to allowing scraping)
- Search interface has reCAPTCHA on contact forms but not on opinion search
- POST endpoint at /Opinion/Search returns HTML results
- Opinion number format: yy-xxxx (e.g., 01-0435)
- No existing scraper for laag court_id
- Site appears to serve opinions in PDF format
- Some JavaScript errors present but page still functional

The search interface provides a way to query opinions, but the exact data format
returned and individual opinion URL patterns would need further investigation by
performing actual searches (requires browser interaction permissions).
"""

priority = "medium"
priority_reasoning = """
Medium priority because:
- Public access, no payment required
- AG opinions are legal documents of public interest
- No existing scraper for this court_id
- Requires JavaScript rendering
- Search interface present but exact URL patterns for individual opinions unclear
- Would require investigating the POST endpoint response format to build scraper
"""

complexity = "moderate"
complexity_reasoning = """
Moderate complexity because:
- Requires JavaScript rendering
- Uses POST endpoint for search (not simple URL pagination)
- Need to reverse-engineer the search API or extract results from HTML
- Individual opinion URLs not immediately visible (need to perform searches)
- May require session management if search results are session-dependent
- reCAPTCHA present on site (though unclear if it protects opinion search)
