New Jersey has a well-maintained unified court website serving the Supreme Court, Superior Court Appellate Division, and Tax Court. All courts provide opinions in PDF format with searchable date ranges and keyword search. The site is publicly accessible with no login requirements.

Existing scrapers in juriscraper already cover all three courts (nj, njsuperctappdiv, njtaxct) for both published and unpublished opinions. The scrapers use the current www.njcourts.gov URLs and parse the HTML structure to extract case metadata.

The site structure is consistent across all court types, using the same HTML patterns and CSS classes. Opinions are paginated (20 per page) and can be filtered by date range. The site uses Drupal CMS and does not require JavaScript for basic functionality.

No hidden APIs were discovered - the site renders opinions as server-side HTML. Document downloads are direct PDF links.
