The DOE Office of Hearings and Appeals publishes weekly decision summaries with links to full PDF documents. The site uses standard Drupal CMS with simple HTML pages and paginated listings (42+ pages of weekly summaries going back to 2013). Decisions cover Personnel Security, FOIA appeals, and other administrative matters. The site has good public access with no login required, though contact forms use reCAPTCHA. No API detected - scraping would involve parsing HTML listings and downloading PDF documents. The court_id 'energyoha' in courts.toml lists opinions, oral_arguments, and dockets as available data types, but oral arguments are not actually published on the website.
