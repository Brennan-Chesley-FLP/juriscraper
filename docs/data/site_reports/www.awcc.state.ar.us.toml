The Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission is an administrative agency, not a traditional court.
It handles workplace injury and workers' compensation disputes. Opinions come from two sources:
1. Administrative Law Judges (ALJ) - initial decisions
2. Full Commission - reviews of ALJ decisions

The domain www.awcc.state.ar.us redirects to labor.arkansas.gov/workers-comp/, indicating it's part
of the Arkansas Department of Labor and Licensing.

The Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission website provides public access to two types of opinions:
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) opinions and Full Commission opinions. Both are organized by year and
appear to be available as PDF documents. The site is WordPress-based, uses static HTML (minimal JS),
and allows scraping with a 10-second crawl delay per robots.txt.

The domain redirects from www.awcc.state.ar.us to labor.arkansas.gov/workers-comp/. The site also
offers online search functionality and various forms/reports related to workers' compensation cases.

No existing scraper exists for this court in the juriscraper codebase. The site structure appears
straightforward - year-based organization with direct PDF links.

Medium priority because:
- Public access with no barriers
- Opinions readily available in PDF format
- Clear URL structure and organization
- No existing scraper coverage
- Workers' compensation opinions are valuable for legal research
- However, as an administrative agency rather than a traditional court, it may have lower priority
  compared to appellate courts

Simple complexity because:
- Static HTML with minimal JavaScript
- Clear year-based organization
- No authentication required
- No captchas or paywalls
- Standard PDF document format

- WordPress-based site with predictable structure
