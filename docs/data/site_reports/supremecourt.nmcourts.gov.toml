summary = """
The New Mexico Supreme Court website (supremecourt.nmcourts.gov) is primarily an
informational portal. Opinions are NOT published on this site - users are redirected
to nmonesource.com, the official legal publisher operated by the NM Compilation Commission.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Existing Coverage**: Working scraper (nm.py) uses nmonesource.com with:
   - Base URL: https://nmonesource.com/nmos/en/d/s/index.do
   - Court code: 182
   - Date-range based searches

2. **Opinion Publishing**:
   - Opinions filed Mondays and Thursdays at 11 AM
   - Email listserv available for notifications
   - Both Supreme Court and Court of Appeals opinions on nmonesource.com

3. **Rate Limiting**: nmonesource.com has artificial limits:
   - 50 requests/minute
   - 100 requests/5 minutes
   - Scraper limits to first 10 results per query

4. **URL Redirect**: nmsupremecourt.nmcourts.gov → supremecourt.nmcourts.gov

5. **Related Systems**:
   - caselookup.nmcourts.gov - Case lookup for all NM courts
   - languageaccess.nmcourts.gov - Language services
   - nmcourts.gov - Main NM courts portal

6. **New Feature**: AI-generated opinion summaries now available on nmonesource.com

**Recommendations:**
- Existing scraper works correctly via nmonesource.com
- No scraping needed from this court website directly
- Consider oral argument scraping if livestream archives are available
- Monitor nmonesource.com rate limits for changes
