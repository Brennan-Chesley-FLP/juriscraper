docs.legis.wisconsin.gov is the Wisconsin Legislative Documents portal that hosts
Attorney General opinions among other legislative materials. AG opinions are available
from 2000 to present in both HTML and PDF formats, with archival opinions from earlier
periods also available.

The site is publicly accessible, has no authentication requirements, and provides
clean HTML and PDF documents. An RSS feed is available for updates. The content is
organized chronologically with simple URL patterns (e.g., /document/oag/oag1-24).

Note: The site also references https://www.wisdoj.gov/Pages/AboutUs/attorney-general-opinions-archive.aspx
as an alternative Department of Justice archive for AG opinions.
