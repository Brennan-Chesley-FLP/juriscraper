summary = """
North Dakota courts use a modern website at www.ndcourts.gov with a Thomson Reuters
ctrack portal at portal.ctrack.ndcourts.gov. The opinions search interface provides
excellent public access to Supreme Court and Court of Appeals opinions with robust
search capabilities. The site has both a user-facing web interface and an underlying
API at portal-api.ctrack.ndcourts.gov.

Existing scrapers provide good coverage of Supreme Court opinions dating back to 1955.
The docket/case management system through the ctrack portal provides additional data
that could be scraped, but no existing scraper covers that functionality.

The API discovery revealed several endpoints that could be leveraged for more efficient
scraping:
- portal-api.ctrack.ndcourts.gov/courts?size=500 - court information
- portal-api.ctrack.ndcourts.gov/cms/casecategories - case type taxonomy
- Likely additional endpoints for case search results (not yet discovered)

Thomson Reuters' ctrack system may be used by other states, so understanding its API
structure could benefit future scraping efforts.
"""

priority = "medium"
priority_reasoning = """
Medium priority because:
- Existing opinion scrapers provide good coverage
- The opinions interface works well and is stable
- The ctrack portal provides docket access but would require new development
- The undocumented API could enable more efficient scraping
- No critical issues with existing scrapers noted

Not high priority because the core opinion scraping is already working well.
Could be elevated if:
- Docket scraping becomes a priority
- The API is better documented or understood
- Issues arise with the current HTML-based scraper
"""

complexity = "moderate"
complexity_reasoning = """
Moderate complexity:
- Opinion scraping: Simple (existing scraper works well, static HTML with pagination)
- Docket scraping: Moderate to Complex (requires understanding the ctrack API, may need
  to handle authentication/sessions, API is undocumented)
- The Thomson Reuters ctrack system uses a modern SPA architecture but appears to
  provide public API access without authentication
- Would benefit from API exploration to understand available endpoints and response formats
