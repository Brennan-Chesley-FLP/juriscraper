Montana Supreme Court (courts.mt.gov) provides excellent public access to opinions, dockets, and oral arguments.
The site uses a clean JSON API at juddocumentservice.mt.gov for daily orders/opinions, which is already covered
by an existing scraper (last updated 2020-02-25).

Key findings:
1. Opinions API is well-structured and actively scraped
2. Oral arguments are available back to 2010 but NOT currently scraped
3. Docket search portal (supremecourtdocket.mt.gov) provides comprehensive case information
4. No JavaScript required, no authentication barriers
5. Site is statewide portal serving the Montana Supreme Court

Recommended next steps:
- Consider building oral arguments scraper (audio/schedule data available)
- Verify existing opinions scraper is still working correctly
- Explore docket portal API if available (may require browser automation)
