This is a tribal court exercising inherent sovereign authority. The court has exclusive
appellate jurisdiction over all civil and criminal matters falling under Mvskoke
(Muscogee Creek Nation) jurisdiction. The court was re-established by Article VII of
the modern Mvskoke Nation Constitution ratified on October 6, 1979.

Seven justices serve six-year terms after nomination by the Principal Chief and
confirmation by the National Council. The court annually selects a Chief Justice and
Vice-Chief Justice from its members.

The website includes a disclaimer that case lists may not be complete and official
docket sheets must be requested from the Court Clerk.

summary = """
The Muscogee (Creek) Nation Supreme Court website is built on Squarespace and provides
public access to final opinions from 2009-present in PDF format. The site has two main
content sections: "Open Cases" (currently active appeals) and "Final Opinions"
(historical archive organized by year).

Opinions and related case documents (briefs, orders) are hosted as static PDFs. The
site requires JavaScript for navigation but the actual document links are accessible
once the page loads. No API exists - this is a standard Squarespace site with
manually uploaded PDF files.

The robots.txt blocks AI training bots (ClaudeBot, GPTBot, etc.) but does not restrict
general web crawling. The site serves a single tribal court jurisdiction.

Live streaming of oral arguments is available during active court sessions via embedded
YouTube, but no archive of past oral arguments is provided.
"""

priority = "medium"
priority_reasoning = """
Medium priority due to:
- Public access with no authentication required
- Good historical coverage back to 2009
- Represents important tribal court jurisdiction
- No existing scraper
- Simple technical implementation (Squarespace + static PDFs)

However:
- Limited scope (single tribal court)
- No API or structured data
- Disclaimer indicates incomplete case lists
- Browse-only interface with no search
"""

complexity = "simple"
complexity_reasoning = """
Simple complexity due to:
- Static HTML pages with predictable structure
- All documents are direct PDF links
- No authentication or rate limiting concerns
- Standard Squarespace platform
- Simple pagination by year

Scraping approach:
1. Parse main opinions page to get case listings by year
2. Extract case numbers, titles, and document links
3. Download PDF documents
4. Parse metadata from filenames and case titles

The main challenges are:
- JavaScript required for initial page rendering
- No structured metadata (must parse from text)
- Manual extraction of dates from filenames
- Expandable sections for some cases require interaction
