Texas has a unique dual supreme court system:
- Supreme Court of Texas (tex) handles civil cases
- Court of Criminal Appeals (texcrimapp) handles criminal cases

hidden form fields. Each court is selected via checkbox parameter like:
- ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$chkListCourts$0 for Supreme Court
- ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$chkListCourts$1 for Court of Criminal Appeals
- ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$chkListCourts$2-15 for the 14 Courts of Appeals

The Texas Appellate Management & E-Filing System (TAMES) is a shared statewide
portal serving all Texas appellate courts. The existing scrapers use POST requests
with complex ASP.NET ViewState parameters to search for opinions by date range.

Key findings:
1. Robots.txt disallows all crawling (Disallow: /)
2. Existing scrapers (tex, texcrimapp, texapp) are working and use this portal
3. Opinions available in PDF and DOC formats
4. Search requires JavaScript and complex POST parameters
5. Alternative access via "Hand Down" lists showing recent releases by date
6. Email subscription service (Case Mail) available for updates
7. Oral argument videos hosted externally at texasbarcle.com

The scraper in juriscraper/opinions/united_states/state/texapp.py handles the
complexity of ASP.NET ViewState and pagination. The texcrimapp scraper inherits
from texapp and just sets checkbox=1 to select the Court of Criminal Appeals.

Priority: LOW - Existing scrapers are functional. Robots.txt technically disallows
scraping but the system has been scraped successfully for years.

5. Multiple HTTP requests per opinion (search results + case page for names)

The existing scraper handles all this complexity well.
