summary = """
Arkansas Courts maintains a modern opinion portal powered by Lexum's Norma platform. The site provides comprehensive coverage of Supreme Court opinions (dating back to 1837) and Court of Appeals opinions (dating back to 1979).

The site uses an iframe-based architecture which may require JavaScript rendering for scraping. However, existing scrapers successfully access opinions via the advanced search endpoint (https://opinions.arcourts.gov/ark/en/d/s/index.do) using date range queries, which is the approach currently used by ark.py and arkctapp.py.

Key features:
- Both courts accessible from single domain
- Advanced search with extensive filters
- RSS feeds available for updates
- No authentication required
- Robots.txt permits scraping (only blocks specific opinions and BUbiNG user agent)
- Documents available in PDF and HTML formats
- Rich metadata including docket numbers, citations, author, opinion type, county, term, disposition

The existing scrapers appear to work well, scraping by date range from the search endpoint. The site has a 25-result pagination limit that the existing scraper is aware of (logs a warning when 25 results are returned).

Note: The task indicated the URL as "courts.arkansas.gov" which does not exist. The correct URL is "opinions.arcourts.gov" as discovered through the existing scraper code.

# Recommended priority for building a scraper
priority = "low"  # Existing scrapers already work well
priority_reasoning = "Existing scrapers (ark.py and arkctapp.py) are already functional and appear to be actively maintained (last updated 2017). The scrapers use a date-range query approach that works around the site's pagination limitations. No immediate need for updates unless scraper functionality breaks."

# Estimated complexity
complexity = "simple"
complexity_reasoning = "Site has clean HTML structure and existing scrapers demonstrate straightforward date-based queries work well. The iframe architecture is already handled by existing implementation. No authentication, captchas, or paywalls. The Lexum platform provides stable URL patterns."
