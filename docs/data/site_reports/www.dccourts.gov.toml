summary = """
DC Courts website (www.dccourts.gov) is a well-organized Drupal-based site serving the District of Columbia Court of Appeals and Superior Court.

**Strengths:**
- Opinions readily available as PDFs with searchable table interface
- No authentication required for opinions
- Clean, structured data presentation
- Oral arguments available via YouTube with archived videos
- Existing scraper already in place and functional

**Limitations:**
- Case dockets require captcha (eAccess system)
- No public API
- MOJs are listed but not linked to full documents (only case name/number)
- Superior Court content less structured than Court of Appeals

**Existing Coverage:**
The existing scraper (juriscraper/opinions/united_states/state/dc.py) covers Court of Appeals opinions, parsing the HTML table on the opinions page. It was updated in 2025 to use OpinionSiteLinear and extract lower court information.

**Recommendations:**
- Existing scraper appears adequate for opinions
- Could potentially add oral arguments scraper using YouTube RSS or page scraping
- eAccess docket system blocked by captcha - not practical to scrape
- Consider monitoring for any API developments
