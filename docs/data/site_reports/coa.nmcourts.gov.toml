summary = """
New Mexico Court of Appeals website (coa.nmcourts.gov) is a WordPress site running LiteSpeed with public access to opinions and oral arguments.

**Opinions**: Both formal and memorandum opinions are available as PDFs, organized by year and month in accordion-style menus. Formal opinions date back to 2009, memorandum opinions to 2018. URL pattern is predictable: wp-content/uploads/sites/43/YYYY/MM/[date-case-name-number].pdf

**Oral Arguments**: Audio recordings (MP3 format) are posted within 72 hours of arguments, available from September 2020 onward. Similar URL pattern to opinions but with .mp3 extension.

**Existing Coverage**: The court already has a scraper (nmctapp.py) that uses NMOneSource (nmonesource.com), which is a different platform. This suggests there may be two separate systems serving New Mexico Court of Appeals content.

**Alternative Source**: Site references New Mexico Compilation Commission's website (www.nmcompcomm.us) for opinions in multiple formats (WordPerfect, Word, PDF).

**Scraping Considerations**:
- Static HTML with accordion menus
- No API detected
- No robots.txt restrictions
- No authentication required
- Predictable URL patterns for direct file access
- Site appears to be the primary public-facing website, while NMOneSource may be a legal research platform

# Recommended priority for building a scraper
priority = "medium"
priority_reasoning = "Court already has opinion coverage through NMOneSource scraper. However, coa.nmcourts.gov may provide more immediate access to slip opinions and adds oral argument audio capability not currently captured. The two sources should be evaluated to determine if they provide complementary coverage or if one is more authoritative/timely."

# Estimated complexity
complexity = "simple"
complexity_reasoning = "Static HTML with predictable URL patterns. Simple accordion-based navigation. PDFs and MP3s directly accessible. No JavaScript rendering required for scraping. Main challenge would be coordinating with existing NMOneSource scraper to avoid duplication."

# Any blockers or concerns?
