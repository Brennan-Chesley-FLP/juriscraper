Delaware Courts operates a comprehensive statewide portal serving all Delaware
state courts. The site provides excellent public access to opinions from all
courts, with a well-structured search interface. Existing scrapers cover the
major courts for opinions (Supreme Court, Court of Chancery, Superior Court,
Court of Common Pleas).

Key findings:
1. Opinions: Fully accessible with good search/filter capabilities
2. Oral Arguments: Video recordings available for Supreme Court
3. Dockets: Civil dockets available through separate CourtConnect system
4. No public API identified
5. Standard HTML/PDF delivery, site functions without JavaScript
6. Multiple existing scrapers already in place

Gaps in existing coverage:
- Family Court opinions (delfamct) - may be limited due to confidentiality
- Court on the Judiciary opinions (deljudct)
- Oral argument video scraping not implemented
- CourtConnect docket data not scraped

The site is well-maintained, frequently updated, and respectful of robots.txt.
Only specific opinion IDs are disallowed, likely problematic cases.
"""

priority_reasoning = """
Good existing scraper coverage for major courts. The missing courts (Family Court,
Court on the Judiciary) may have limited public data due to the nature of cases.
Oral arguments are available but video scraping is complex. CourtConnect docket
system would require separate integration. Main opinion sources are already covered.

For opinions: Simple HTML scraping, existing patterns work well, no JavaScript
required, standard URL patterns. The existing scrapers demonstrate this.

For new features (oral arguments, CourtConnect dockets): Would be moderate complexity
due to separate systems and video handling requirements.
