summary = """
The Florida Supreme Court website provides excellent public access to opinions, dockets, and oral arguments. The site uses a modern Next.js frontend with a JSON API backend (flcourts-media.flcourts.gov). An existing scraper successfully uses this API for opinions.

Key infrastructure:
1. **Opinions API**: flcourts-media.flcourts.gov/_search/opinions/ - Well-structured JSON responses with pagination, date filtering
2. **ACIS Portal**: acis.flcourts.gov - Thomson Reuters platform for dockets, filings, party/attorney info
3. **Oral Arguments**: Archived on multiple platforms (WFSU, YouTube, Facebook) from 1997-present

The robots.txt disallows general user agents but the existing scraper has been successful using the opinions API. The API appears designed for programmatic access despite robots.txt restrictions.

Oral argument videos/audio are available but not currently scraped. The ACIS docket system provides comprehensive case information but would require separate implementation.
