summary = """
The Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe Court of Appeals maintains a public Case Law Reporter with opinions from 1993-2017.
The site uses a simple static HTML structure with direct links to PDF opinions. Each case includes a docket number,
date, case name, and summary. However, the reporter has not been updated since 2017, which is a significant concern.

The court appears active based on other site content (current justices listed, active eFiling system, court rules
dated as recently as 2023), so the lack of recent opinions on the website may indicate a lapse in public
reporting rather than cessation of court operations.

The site does not require JavaScript and has no robots.txt restrictions, making it technically straightforward
to scrape. However, the lack of recent data significantly limits the value of creating a scraper.
"""

priority = "low"
priority_reasoning = "The case law reporter has not been updated since 2017. Without recent opinions, there is limited value in creating a scraper. However, if the court resumes publishing opinions online, this would become a higher priority as it's a relatively easy site to scrape and represents an important tribal court jurisdiction."

complexity = "simple"
