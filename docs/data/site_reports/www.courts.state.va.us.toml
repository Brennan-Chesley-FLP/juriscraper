The Virginia Court System website provides good public access to opinions for both the
Supreme Court and Court of Appeals. Existing scrapers already cover the main opinion
pages effectively. The site also has an Appellate Case Management System (ACMS-SCV)
that provides docket information but would require more complex scraping with session
management.

The site is built on Drupal and has some JavaScript issues (jQuery not loading properly)
but the core HTML content is accessible without JavaScript rendering.

Key opportunities:
1. ACMS system could provide richer docket/case data but requires form-based searching
2. Oral arguments availability should be investigated further
3. Lower court case information systems were mentioned but not fully explored
4. Court directories and judge information may be available

The existing scrapers appear to be working well for opinions. No immediate scraper
updates seem necessary unless the URLs have changed.

Existing scrapers already cover the primary use case (opinions). Priority is medium for:
1. Exploring ACMS docket data (would require more complex scraping)
2. Investigating oral arguments archives

The site allows scraping per robots.txt and provides good public access.
