The Texas Supreme Court is the state's highest court for civil matters. Criminal appeals go to the Court of Criminal Appeals (a separate court).

The site structure changed in October 2014, creating a clean break between modern and historical content.

During May 2020, there was a network outage and opinions from that period are available in a special section with direct PDF links.

Lower court information is systematically parsed and includes:
- Texas Courts of Appeals (with district numbers)
- Board of Disciplinary Appeals (BODA)
- U.S. Fifth Circuit appeals

The domain www.txcourts.gov is actually the Texas Judicial Branch portal and likely hosts content for multiple Texas courts, not just the Supreme Court. Other courts may include the Court of Criminal Appeals and various Courts of Appeals.

summary = """
The Texas Supreme Court has excellent online coverage through www.txcourts.gov/supreme/. Key findings:

**Domain Mismatch**: The court_url in courts.toml points to www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us (which does not resolve). The actual URL is www.txcourts.gov/supreme/. The old domain appears to be defunct.

**Opinions**: Comprehensive coverage from October 2014 to present, organized by year and date. Each release date page contains all orders and opinions issued that day, with PDFs for each opinion type (majority, concurrence, dissent, per curiam). Historical opinions (pre-2014) available through legacy system and bulk PDFs.

**Existing Scraper**: An active scraper exists (juriscraper.opinions.united_states.state.tex) that targets this site using the correct URL pattern: https://www.txcourts.gov/supreme/orders-opinions/{year}/

**Structure**: Opinions are well-structured with tables containing:
- Case number (docket)
- Case title with party names
- Lower court information (court name, district, case number)
- Opinion PDFs (majority, concurrences, dissents)
- Judge/Justice names

**Other Content**:
- Case search system on search.txcourts.gov subdomain
- Oral arguments videos through Texas Bar CLE
- Electronic briefs
- Case mail subscription service
- Document search

**Technical**: Static HTML site, no JavaScript required for content access. No public API discovered. The site uses Microsoft IIS and appears to be built on Umbraco CMS (based on robots.txt disallow rules).

**Robots Policy**: robots.txt exists with commented-out rate limiting suggestions (720 second crawl-delay, 1 request per 5 seconds). Most disallowed paths are admin/system directories. Opinion content is explicitly allowed.
