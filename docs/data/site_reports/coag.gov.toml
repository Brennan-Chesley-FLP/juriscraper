# Free-form notes from the research process
summary = """
The Colorado Attorney General website (coag.gov) provides formal legal opinions
from 1994 to present, organized by year. Each opinion is available as a PDF.
The site is built on WordPress and does not require JavaScript for basic browsing.

Opinions are organized into year-based pages with consistent URL structure:
- Index: https://coag.gov/attorney-general-opinions/
- Year page: https://coag.gov/attorney-general-opinions/YYYY-formal-ag-opinions/
- PDF: https://coag.gov/app/uploads/YYYY/MM/AG-Formal-Opinion-No-YY-NN.pdf

Each year page lists opinions with:
- Opinion number (e.g., "No. 24-01")
- Brief description of the legal question addressed
- Link to PDF

The site explicitly states this is not a complete archive. For complete historical
coverage, researchers should contact the Colorado Supreme Court Library.

There is no existing scraper for this court (coloag). Other state AG scrapers exist
(texag, calag, nyag, etc.) that could serve as implementation templates.
"""

# Recommended priority for building a scraper
priority = "medium"
priority_reasoning = """
Medium priority because:
- Public access with no barriers (no login, no captcha, no payment)
- Simple, consistent URL structure for scraping
- Attorney General opinions are valuable legal resources
- No existing scraper for this court
- However, coverage is acknowledged as incomplete (complete archive at CO Supreme Court Library)
- Opinion volume is relatively low (few opinions per year)
- Similar AG opinion scrapers already exist as templates
"""

# Estimated complexity
complexity = "simple"
complexity_reasoning = """
Simple implementation because:
- Static HTML, no JavaScript required
- Consistent URL patterns across years
- Clear year-based organization (1994-2024)
- Direct PDF links with predictable naming
- No pagination within year pages
- No authentication or rate limiting concerns
- Can follow pattern of existing AG opinion scrapers (texag, calag, etc.)

Implementation would involve:
1. Iterate through year pages from 1994-2024
2. Parse HTML to extract opinion numbers, descriptions, and PDF URLs
3. Download PDFs
4. Extract metadata from page structure

Potential challenges:
- Need to monitor for new years being added
- Some years may have no opinions (e.g., 2022 appears missing)
- May want to cross-reference with Colorado Supreme Court Library for completeness
