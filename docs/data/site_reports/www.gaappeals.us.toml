The Georgia Court of Appeals website provides good public access to opinions and docket information. The site uses WordPress with static HTML pages and PHP-based search functionality. An existing juriscraper exists but needs updating for the domain migration from .us to .gov.

Key findings:
1. Opinions available via date-range search from 2003-present in PDF format
2. Docket search supports multiple search methods (case number, trial court number, party name)
3. Oral argument videos available on Vimeo with organized archive
4. No JavaScript rendering required for core functionality
5. robots.txt allows scraping except /wp-admin/
6. URGENT: Domain transition from www.gaappeals.us to www.gaappeals.gov is in progress

The existing scraper at juriscraper/opinions/united_states/state/gactapp.py successfully scrapes opinions by date range. The scraper needs a simple URL update to use the new .gov domain.
