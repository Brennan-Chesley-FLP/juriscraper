Both Puyallup Tribal Court and Puyallup Tribal Court of Appeals publish
significant opinions as PDFs organized by topic/subject matter.

Tribal Court opinions are organized into 10 categories (attorney matters,
contract, criminal, fishing/hunting, full faith & credit, tort claims,
traffic, workers' compensation, probate).

Court of Appeals opinions are organized into 15 categories (adoption/TPR,
administrative appeals, court clerk assistance, attorney's fees, child welfare,
evidence, criminal, eviction, disbarment, child custody, sovereign immunity,
fishing/hunting, jurisdiction, workers' compensation, full faith & credit).

Note: These are "significant" cases only - not all court opinions are published.
The disclaimer states these hold "persuasive, not binding" authority.

Opinions are available as direct PDF downloads from WordPress uploads directory.

summary = """
The Puyallup Tribal Courts publish selected significant opinions online as PDFs.
The site is a WordPress installation that provides browse-only access to opinions
organized by subject matter. Both trial court and appellate opinions are available.

The court system participates in the Northwest Intertribal Court System (NICS),
and some opinions have NICS App. citations. However, many opinions lack formal
citations.

Opinions are available as direct PDF downloads from the WordPress uploads directory.
There is no API, no search functionality, and no structured metadata. Each opinion
would need to be individually downloaded and parsed to extract case information.

Key technical details:
- Platform: WordPress
- Format: PDF documents only
- Organization: Topical categories (25 categories total across both courts)
- Access: Direct HTTP links to PDFs in /wp-content/uploads/
- No JavaScript required for access
- No authentication required
"""

priority = "medium"
priority_reasoning = """
Medium priority for scraper development because:
- Tribal court opinions are underrepresented in legal databases
- Puyallup Tribe is a significant Washington tribe with active court system
- Opinions are publicly available without restrictions
- However: Only "significant" cases are published, not comprehensive coverage
- No existing scraper in the codebase
- Would require PDF parsing to extract structured data
- No obvious way to detect new opinions automatically (no RSS, no date-sorted index)
"""

complexity = "moderate"
complexity_reasoning = """
Moderate complexity because:
- Need to scrape multiple category pages to find all opinions
- Must parse HTML to extract PDF URLs from collapsible sections
- Requires PDF text extraction to get case metadata (dates, parties, holdings)
- No API or structured data format
- URL patterns are in WordPress uploads directory (descriptive filenames)
- Would need to maintain local cache to detect new opinions
- No date-based indexing makes backfilling and updates challenging

Simpler aspects:
- No JavaScript rendering required
- No authentication needed
- Direct PDF links work without sessions
- robots.txt allows scraping
