- The API uses different keys for author and posting type depending on the court:

  * Superior Court uses AuthorName and PostingTypeCode
  * Commonwealth Court uses AuthorName and PostingTypeId

- Superior Court distinguishes between "Precedential" and "Non-Precedential" opinions via PublicationType.Description

- Opinions are grouped into clusters with multiple sub-opinions (majority, concurring, dissenting, etc.)

- The UJS Portal (ujsportal.pacourts.us) is a separate system for docket sheets and case information, with both public and secure access levels

summary = """
Pennsylvania has an excellent, well-structured system for accessing court opinions via an undocumented JSON API. The site serves three appellate courts (Supreme, Superior, Commonwealth) plus the Court of Judicial Discipline. Existing scrapers are already in place and actively maintained.

Key findings:
1. **JSON API**: Undocumented but functional API at /api/opinion with comprehensive filters
2. **Full coverage**: All three main appellate courts are covered by existing scrapers
3. **Good data quality**: Structured JSON responses with consistent fields
4. **Historical data**: Coverage back to 1998 for all three courts
5. **RSS feeds**: Available for each court for ongoing monitoring
6. **Separate docket system**: UJS Portal at ujsportal.pacourts.us handles dockets separately

The existing scrapers (pa.py, pasuperct.py, pacommwct.py) use the JSON API effectively and handle the various opinion types, precedential status, and multi-opinion clusters appropriately.

No significant gaps in opinion coverage. Docket data is available but through a different portal (ujsportal.pacourts.us) and would require separate scraper development if needed.
