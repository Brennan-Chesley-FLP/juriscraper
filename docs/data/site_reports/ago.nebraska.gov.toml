These are Attorney General legal opinions, not court opinions. They are advisory opinions
prepared in response to specific legal questions from state agencies, state officials, state
legislators (on questions relating to proposed or pending legislation), or county attorneys
(on criminal matters and matters relating to public revenue).

The Attorney General is NOT authorized to give opinions to local governmental officials
(except county attorneys on specific matters) or private citizens.

The site notes that opinions may have limitations based on who can request them:
- State agencies/officials: general questions relating to performance of duties
- State legislators: questions relating to proposed/pending legislation or functions of the Legislature

summary = """
The Nebraska AG website provides access to Attorney General opinions from 1989 onwards at
https://ago.nebraska.gov/Opinions. These are legal advisory opinions, not court decisions.

The site is built on Drupal and designed by Tyler Technologies. Opinions are presented in a
paginated table format (120 pages with ~10 opinions per page = ~1200 opinions) with columns
for: opinion number (e.g., 25-003), date, title, and PDF download link. There's a year
filter available and full-text search capability.

PDF URLs follow a consistent pattern: /sites/default/files/docs/opinions/{filename}.pdf
where the filename typically includes the opinion number and sometimes a description.

The site requires JavaScript for the table display and filtering functionality. There is
no JSON API exposed - opinions are served as static PDFs. The robots.txt file allows
general scraping but disallows /admin/, /search/, and Drupal core paths.

An RSS feed is available at /rss/news for general news updates (not specific to opinions).

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: A scraper would need to:
1. Parse the paginated table at /Opinions (120 pages, param: ?page=N)
2. Extract opinion number, date, title, and PDF URL for each entry
3. Download PDFs from /sites/default/files/docs/opinions/ paths
4. Handle JavaScript rendering or parse the HTML table structure directly

The /opinions/archive page shows all opinions on a single page but generates extremely
large HTML output (>1MB), so pagination-based scraping is preferable.
"""

priority = "medium"
priority_reasoning = "AG opinions are legally significant documents for understanding state law interpretation, and there is no existing scraper. The site has good coverage from 1989-present with consistent URL patterns. However, they are advisory opinions rather than binding court precedent."

complexity = "moderate"
complexity_reasoning = "The site requires JavaScript rendering for the opinion listing table. The pagination structure is straightforward (?page=N for 120 pages), and PDF URL patterns are consistent. No API is available, so scraping must be HTML-based. The Drupal platform is well-structured but requires handling dynamic content."
