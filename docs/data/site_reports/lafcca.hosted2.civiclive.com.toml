The Louisiana Court of Appeal First Circuit maintains a well-structured website on the CivicLive platform.
Opinions are available via an undocumented JSON API (ContentItemSvc.asmx) that returns metadata and download
links. An existing scraper is in place but requires periodic maintenance for parameter updates.

The site provides comprehensive opinion coverage from 1988 to present. Oral argument dockets/calendars are
available but not the arguments themselves. A separate records system exists (ecaseaccess.la-fcca.org) but
requires authentication/cookies.

The API endpoint POST /portal/svc/ContentItemSvc.asmx/GetItemList accepts a parentId and Params JSON
payload to retrieve paginated opinion lists with download URLs.
