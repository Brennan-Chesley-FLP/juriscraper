summary = """
The Hawaii State Judiciary website (www.courts.state.hi.us) is a comprehensive statewide portal
serving the Hawaii Supreme Court and Intermediate Court of Appeals. The site is publicly accessible
with no registration or payment requirements.

Key findings:
- **Opinions**: Available from 1998 to present, divided into two archives (1998-2009 and 2010-present)
- **Oral Arguments**: Audio recordings (MP3) available from March 21, 2007 to present
- **Platform**: WordPress-based site with standard HTML structure, no complex JavaScript requirements
- **Existing Coverage**: Four scrapers already exist for Hawaii opinions (haw, hawapp, and _beginningofyear variants)
- **Update Policy**: Opinions posted by 2pm on the same day they are filed
- **Search**: Full-text search functionality available for opinions

The site has a clean, accessible structure that is scraper-friendly. The existing opinion scrapers
cover the main use case. The primary gap is oral arguments - audio recordings are available but
no scraper currently exists for them.

Technical notes:
- Site uses WordPress (wp-content, wp-admin paths)
- Robots.txt only restricts wp-admin area
- No API detected, standard HTML scraping required
- PDF documents for opinions
- MP3 audio for oral arguments
- Site includes Firebase chat widget but core content loads without JavaScript
"""

# Recommended priority for building a scraper
priority = "medium"
priority_reasoning = """
Existing opinion scrapers are already in place and functional. The main opportunity is adding
oral argument audio scraping capability. This would be a valuable addition given the audio archive
goes back to 2007. Medium priority because opinions (the primary content) are already covered.
"""

# Estimated complexity
complexity = "simple"
complexity_reasoning = """
The site structure is straightforward HTML with clear navigation patterns. No authentication,
captchas, or complex JavaScript required. Opinion scraping is already proven to work via existing
scrapers. Adding oral argument scraping would likely follow similar patterns - navigate archive
pages and extract MP3 links with metadata. The WordPress platform is stable and well-understood.
