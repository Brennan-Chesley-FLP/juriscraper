These are Attorney General legal opinions, not court opinions. They are advisory opinions
on state law interpretation requested by elected officials and government agencies. The site
notes that many factors including subsequent legislation and court decisions can affect the
validity of past opinions.

DUAL SITE ARCHITECTURE: The Kansas AG opinions are published on two different websites:
1. ag.ks.gov (official AG office site) - 2023-present, Granicus CMS, JavaScript required
2. ksag.washburnlaw.edu (Washburn Law School mirror) - 1974-present, static HTML, RSS feed

Both sites contain the same current opinions but with different URL structures. The Washburn
site is maintained as an academic resource and provides better access for automated scraping.

[research_notes]
summary = """
The Kansas AG website provides access to Attorney General opinions from 2023 onwards at
https://ag.ks.gov/reports-resources/ag-opinions. These are legal advisory opinions, not
court decisions. The opinions are presented in a table format organized by year, with each
opinion having a number (e.g., 2026-1, 2025-26), a summary, cited statutes, and an issue
date. The full opinions are available as PDF documents accessed via URLs with unique
document IDs in the format: /home/showpublisheddocument/{id}/{timestamp}.

The site is built on the Granicus platform and requires JavaScript. There is no JSON API
exposed - opinions are served as static PDFs via document IDs. The robots.txt file allows
scraping except for /admin and /scripts paths.

IMPORTANT: For comprehensive historical coverage, the Washburn Law School database at
https://ksag.washburnlaw.edu/ provides opinions from 1974-present with a much simpler URL
structure: /opinions/{year}/{opinion-number}.pdf. This site also offers an RSS feed for
new opinions at https://ksag.washburnlaw.edu/rss/ksagopinions.xml. The Washburn site uses
static HTML and does not require JavaScript, making it significantly easier to scrape.

RECOMMENDATION: A scraper should target the Washburn database primarily, as it offers:
1. Complete historical coverage (1974-present) vs. partial coverage (2023-present) on ag.ks.gov
2. Simpler, predictable URL patterns for PDFs
3. No JavaScript requirement
4. RSS feed for monitoring new opinions
5. Both sites contain the same current opinions, but Washburn is more scraper-friendly

The ag.ks.gov site could be used as a fallback or validation source.

priority = "medium"
priority_reasoning = "AG opinions are legally significant documents for understanding state law interpretation, and there is no existing scraper. However, they are advisory opinions rather than binding court precedent. The Washburn database provides excellent coverage and accessibility via RSS, making this a good candidate for a scraper."

complexity = "simple"
complexity_reasoning = "While the main ag.ks.gov site requires JavaScript and has complex document IDs, the Washburn Law School mirror site (https://ksag.washburnlaw.edu/) offers the same content with simple, predictable URL patterns (/opinions/{year}/{number}.pdf), static HTML, and an RSS feed. A scraper targeting Washburn would be straightforward to implement."
