summary = """
Vermont Judiciary provides comprehensive public access to Supreme Court opinions through a Drupal-based website.
The site has existing, working scrapers for Supreme Court and all Superior Court divisions.

Key findings:
- Opinions: Well-structured Drupal views with filtering by date and division, existing scrapers working
- Published opinions available 1999-present, unpublished entry orders also available
- Public Portal (Tyler Odyssey): Civil and Judicial Bureau cases accessible remotely without login
- Other case types require registration for elevated access or courthouse terminal
- Electronic filing handled through separate Odyssey File & Serve system (vermont.tylertech.cloud)
- Site uses Drupal CMS with standard robots.txt
- Multiple scrapers already exist covering Supreme Court and all Superior Court divisions

Contact: Monica Bombard (802) 828-4784 for site issues - noted as very responsive.
