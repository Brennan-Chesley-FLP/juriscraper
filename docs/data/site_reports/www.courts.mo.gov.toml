Missouri Courts (www.courts.mo.gov) is a well-maintained statewide portal providing
public access to appellate opinions from the Supreme Court and all three Court of
Appeals districts.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Existing Coverage**: Working scrapers exist for all four Missouri appellate courts:
   - mo.py (Supreme Court)
   - moctapp_eastern.py, moctapp_southern.py, moctapp_western.py (Court of Appeals districts)

2. **Opinion Structure**: Opinions are organized by date with rich metadata including:
   - Case number (docket)
   - Case title with party names
   - Author and vote information
   - Concurrence/dissent details
   - Separate Overview/Summary documents

3. **URL Patterns**: Predictable structure makes scraping straightforward:
   - Browse by year: /page.jsp?id=12086&dist=Opinions%20Supreme&date=all&year=2026
   - Court-specific: dist=Opinions Eastern/Southern/Western
   - Documents: /file.jsp?id={document_id}

4. **Historical Data**: Available from 1997 to present.

5. **Supplementary Content**:
   - Court minutes (non-opinion rulings) via Lotus Notes
   - Oral arguments schedule
   - Case.net for docket search (though blocked by robots.txt)

6. **robots.txt**: Allows scraping of opinions pages. Blocks Case.net, eFiling, and
   training-specific AI bots (Google-Extended, GPTBot).

**Recommendations:**
- Existing opinion scrapers are functional - no changes needed
- Oral arguments scraping could be added if audio/video is available
- Case.net docket scraping would violate robots.txt directives
