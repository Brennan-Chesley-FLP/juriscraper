summary = """
Arizona courts maintain a comprehensive public website with excellent opinion coverage dating back to 1998. The site has a clean API endpoint for opinions (/API/Azcourts/Opinions/GetOpinions) that returns JSON data with rich metadata including judge involvement, case types, and constitutionality flags.

Key findings:
1. **API Discovery**: Found undocumented JSON API at /API/Azcourts/Opinions/GetOpinions with comprehensive search parameters
2. **Oral Arguments**: Excellent coverage via Granicus platform (2006-2026) with search and RSS feeds
3. **Docket Access**: Limited by CAPTCHA protection on public access portal
4. **Existing Scrapers**: Three scrapers exist but use old URLs - should be updated to use new API

Technical notes:
- Site works without JavaScript for opinion search
- API supports pagination (page parameter)
- Search parameters: searchPhrase, startDate, endDate, court, decisionType, decisionInvolvementType, judgeId, caseType, caseSubType, constitutionalityOpinionsOnly
- Court parameter values: "Supreme" for Arizona Supreme Court, likely "CourtOfAppeals" or similar for appellate courts
- PDF documents stored at /Portals/0/OpinionFiles/[Court]/[Year]/[filename].pdf

Barriers:
- CAPTCHA on docket search portal (apps.azcourts.gov/publicaccess)
- eAccess portal may require separate authentication for full document access
