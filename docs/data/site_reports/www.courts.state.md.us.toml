Maryland Courts maintain a well-organized public website with good access to appellate opinions.
The primary opinions interface uses a CGI script (indexlist.pl) that provides year-based browsing
dating back to 1995. Existing scrapers in juriscraper already cover both appellate courts.

The site is Drupal-based with standard robots.txt restrictions on admin/user paths but allows
opinion scraping. Documents are provided in PDF format with structured metadata.

Case search functionality is available through a separate subdomain (casesearch.courts.state.md.us)
which is undergoing a major upgrade to a new portal system as of January 9, 2026.

The court system recently underwent a name change (Court of Appeals → Supreme Court of Maryland,
Court of Special Appeals → Appellate Court of Maryland) which should be noted for historical
context but doesn't affect scraping.

Existing scrapers already provide comprehensive coverage of opinions from both Maryland appellate courts.

better data access.
