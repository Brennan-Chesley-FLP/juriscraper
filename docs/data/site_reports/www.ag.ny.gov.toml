The New York Attorney General's website provides public access to legal opinions
issued since 1995. These are advisory legal opinions provided to state agencies
(formal opinions) and local governments (informal opinions).

Key findings:
- 536 opinions available from 1995-present
- All opinions in PDF format
- Three search methods: numerical index, subject, statute
- Existing scraper in repository but uses outdated URL pattern
- Drupal-based CMS
- Public access, no authentication required
- No JavaScript rendering required for opinion lists
- Clear, consistent metadata for each opinion

The opinions represent the Attorney General's legal interpretations and while
not binding court precedent, they carry significant persuasive authority for
New York law interpretation.
"""

priority = "medium"
priority_reasoning = """
Medium priority due to:
+ Existing scraper coverage (though needs update)
+ Significant volume of opinions (536+)
+ Public access with no barriers
+ Clear legal research value
+ Well-structured metadata
+ PDF format readily available

- Not court decisions (advisory opinions only)
- Existing scraper already provides coverage
- Scraper needs URL pattern update
- Moderate volume compared to court opinions
- Specialized audience (government lawyers primarily)
"""

complexity = "simple"
complexity_reasoning = """
Simple complexity because:
- Static HTML pages for opinion lists
- Minimal JavaScript required
- Clear, consistent page structure
- PDF downloads with direct URLs
- Pagination is straightforward
- No authentication or rate limiting
- Existing scraper provides model (just needs URL update)

The main work would be updating the existing scraper to use the new URL
pattern (/libraries-documents/opinions/opinions-year instead of
appeals-and-opinions/numerical-index).
