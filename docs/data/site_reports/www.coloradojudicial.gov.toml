summary = """
Colorado's judicial branch has migrated from www.courts.state.co.us to www.coloradojudicial.gov. The opinion database is now hosted on a vLex-powered platform at research.coloradojudicial.gov.

The existing scrapers (colo.py for Supreme Court, coloctapp.py for Court of Appeals) successfully use the vLex JSON API. Key API details:

**API Structure:**
- Base URL: https://research.coloradojudicial.gov/search.json
- Search parameters include: product_id=COLORADO, jurisdiction=US, content_type=2, court={court_code}
- Court codes: 14024_01 (Supreme Court), 14024_02 (Court of Appeals)
- Requires specific headers: X-Requested-With, X-Root-Account-Email, X-User-Email, X-Webapp-Seed
- Supports pagination with per_page parameter (max 500 to avoid server errors)
- Detail endpoint provides full metadata: /vid/{id}.json

**Data Available:**
- Case names, docket numbers, decision dates
- Citations (both Colorado official and Pacific Reporter)
- PDF URLs for Supreme Court, HTML content for Court of Appeals
- Publication status (Published/Unpublished)
- Abstracts and case summaries

The API returns structured JSON with nested properties that include all necessary metadata. The existing scrapers are well-maintained with recent updates (2023-2025) and handle the vLex API correctly.
"""

priority = "low"
priority_reasoning = "Excellent existing scrapers already in place for both Supreme Court and Court of Appeals. The scrapers use the vLex JSON API effectively and have been recently updated (2023-2025). No additional work needed."

# Estimated complexity
complexity = "simple"
complexity_reasoning = "The vLex JSON API is well-structured and provides all necessary metadata in a clean format. The existing scrapers demonstrate that this is a straightforward integration. However, note that specific headers are required for the API to work correctly."
