summary = """
The U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico provides opinions through a
Document Retrieval System (DRS) at https://www.nmcourt.uscourts.gov/Drs-Web/input.

**Key Findings:**
- DRS opinions portal is publicly accessible and free (no PACER payment required)
- System requires JavaScript and uses complex form submission
- Search capabilities include full-text search, case number, judge name, nature of suit,
  event category, case type, and date range
- Extensive event/document type coverage (hundreds of event types including various
  opinions, orders, memoranda)
- No simple Opinions.pl CGI script like some other federal district courts
- Standard PACER/CM/ECF infrastructure for dockets (requires payment)
- Recently implemented SDS (Sealed Document Security) system restricting electronic
  access to sealed documents

**Technical Challenges:**
- Complex search form with many optional parameters
- JavaScript required for form interaction
- No public API or simple URL patterns
- Would require POST request handling with proper form data
- May need session/cookie management
- Results page structure unknown without performing actual searches

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Study the DRS form structure and POST parameters
2. Implement form submission with appropriate search parameters
3. Parse results pages to extract opinion metadata and download URLs
4. Respect 10-second crawl delay specified in robots.txt
5. Consider implementing date-based incremental scraping
"""

priority = "medium"

Medium priority because:
- Public opinions access without PACER payment is valuable
- No existing scraper for this court
- Federal district court opinions are important for legal research
- However, technical complexity is higher than simple list-based scrapers
- DRS system requires form handling and JavaScript
- Alternative federal sources (PACER, CourtListener RECAP) may already provide coverage

- JavaScript-required form submission
- Complex search form with many parameters
- No simple URL patterns for direct access

- Would need to reverse-engineer form submission and parse HTML results
