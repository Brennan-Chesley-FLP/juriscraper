summary = """
Fort Peck Tribal Court maintains a Squarespace website with good public access to appellate opinions and administrative orders. Key findings:

1. **Appellate Opinions**: 1000+ opinions available, organized in batches of 100. Complete archive available as single PDF on Google Drive. Individual PDFs available for many (but not all) opinions.

2. **Administrative Orders**: PDFs available from 2014-2023 covering various court procedures and policies.

3. **Tribal Code**: 2024 Comprehensive Code of Justice with Supplemental A available.

4. **Access**: Fully public, no login or payment required. Documents hosted on Google Drive with some PDFs on Squarespace CDN.

5. **Technical**: Squarespace platform with React frontend. Requires JavaScript. Documents in PDF format only.

6. **Search**: FreeFind search engine integrated for site-wide and opinion-specific searches.

The site structure is straightforward and scraping would primarily involve:
- Parsing opinion list pages to get case numbers and titles
- Downloading PDFs from Google Drive and/or Squarespace CDN
- Handling both individual opinion PDFs and bulk downloads

Challenges:
- Google Drive hosting means URLs may change
- Some opinions listed but PDFs not individually linked (may only be in bulk download)
- robots.txt blocks many AI crawlers (but not general scraping)
