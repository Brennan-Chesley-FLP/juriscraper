Compensation Review Board (CRB) opinions are available from 1993 to present.

Opinions are organized by year and indexed both by case name and by statute/regulation.

The Connecticut Workers' Compensation Commission provides public access to

decisions available. The site is currently split between a legacy system

Key findings:
- Opinions available from 1993-present (2,500+ decisions)
- All opinions in PDF format
- Organized by year and indexed by case name and statute
- No existing scraper for this court in the repository
- Site is in migration from legacy to new portal
- No JavaScript rendering required for opinion lists
- No API available
- Public access, no authentication required

The opinions represent administrative law decisions from Connecticut's workers'
compensation appellate body. These are binding precedents for workers' compensation
cases in Connecticut and would be valuable additions to a legal database.

Medium priority due to:
+ Significant volume of decisions (2,500+)
+ Public access with no barriers
+ Clear URL patterns for scraping
+ Legal precedent value for workers' comp cases
+ No existing coverage in repository

- Niche subject matter (workers' compensation only)
- Site migration in progress may cause URL instability
- PDF-only format requires additional processing
- Split across two different site architectures
- Administrative law rather than general judicial opinions

complexity = "moderate"

Moderate complexity because:
- Multiple URL patterns across legacy and new sites
- Year-based directory structure requires iteration
- PDF extraction needed for full text
- Site migration means scraper may need updates
- Need to handle both legacy HTML structure and new portal
- Three different time period ranges to handle (1993-2021, 2013-2022, 2023+)

Simpler aspects:
- No authentication required
- Static HTML for opinion lists (minimal JavaScript)
- No rate limiting observed
- Clear organization by year
- Consistent PDF naming patterns
