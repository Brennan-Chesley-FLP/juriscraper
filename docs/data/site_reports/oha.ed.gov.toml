summary = """
The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) within the U.S. Department of Education maintains a searchable
database of administrative decisions. The site redirects from oha.ed.gov to www.ed.gov/laws-and-policy/hearings-and-appeals.

Key findings:
- 893 judges' decisions available in searchable database
- Separate database for Secretary decisions (appeals of OHA decisions)
- Additional database for waiver and offset decisions (salary overpayment matters)
- AJAX API endpoint discovered: https://www.ed.gov/datagrid/ajax/table/oha_judges_decisions
- No robots.txt file present
- JavaScript required for database table functionality
- All decisions available as PDFs
- Site explicitly states decisions are public domain works

The database table is powered by DataTables (jQuery plugin) and loads data via AJAX. This makes it
straightforward to scrape programmatically by calling the AJAX endpoint directly rather than parsing
the HTML table.

Decisions are organized by docket number with a clear naming convention (e.g., 25-31-CP, 24-38-WG).
The database shows 10 entries per page by default with pagination for the full 893 decisions.
