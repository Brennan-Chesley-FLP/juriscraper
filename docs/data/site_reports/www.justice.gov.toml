The BIA website provides excellent access to precedent decisions through a well-organized volume system. All 29 volumes are available online with PDFs for each decision. The existing juriscraper implementation appears comprehensive and up-to-date (last updated 2025-04-25).

The site structure is straightforward HTML with no JavaScript requirements or API. Each volume page lists decisions in a table format with case names, citations, PDF links, docket IDs, and summaries. PDFs are directly accessible without authentication.

The scraper extracts: case name, citation, URL to PDF, docket ID, summary, and attempts to extract the exact filing date from the PDF text (defaulting to July 1 of the decision year if not found).

The site also has a captcha on robots.txt access but not on the actual content pages. No rate limiting was observed during research.
