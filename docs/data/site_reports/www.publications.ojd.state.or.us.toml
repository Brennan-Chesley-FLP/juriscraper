Oregon uses OCLC's ContentDM platform to host court documents. The system
provides a well-documented API that returns JSON data. An existing scraper
(juriscraper.opinions.united_states.state.or) already covers this court
and appears to be working correctly as of 2025-09-23.

The original URL (www.publications.ojd.state.or.us) no longer resolves and
has been replaced by ojd.contentdm.oclc.org. The existing scraper uses the
correct current URLs.

Key technical details:
- Platform: OCLC ContentDM
- Primary API: cdm17027.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/api/
- Collection code: p17027coll3
- Search by date range supported
- Maximum 200 records per API request
- PDF downloads available via /download endpoint
- Robots.txt allows API access with 1-second crawl delay
- JavaScript required for web interface but API accessible without JS

The scraper is well-maintained with recent updates in 2025 and implements
proper date range searching with 15-day intervals.

- Collection codes
- Secondary requests for detail metadata
- Multi-level JSON structure (parent/child fields)

However, the API is well-structured and documented, making implementation
straightforward once the pattern is understood.
