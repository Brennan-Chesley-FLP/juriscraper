Tennessee has a unique appellate structure with separate courts for civil (Supreme Court and Court of Appeals) and criminal (Court of Criminal Appeals) matters.

The Supreme Court also handles Workers' Compensation appeals, which have a separate opinions section.

The site serves as a statewide portal for all Tennessee courts, including trial courts, appellate courts, and specialized courts.

Court of Appeals is divided into three sections: Eastern, Middle, and Western.

Tennessee has an excellent statewide court portal at www.tncourts.gov with comprehensive online resources. Key findings:

**Opinions**: Outstanding opinions database for all three appellate courts with advanced search capabilities. Opinions available as PDF downloads with rich metadata:
- Case number and citation
- Authoring judge (Justice/Judge)
- Trial court judge
- County of origin
- Full text summary
- Multiple opinion types (majority, concurrence, dissent, separate opinions)
- Searchable by multiple criteria (county, judge, date, case name, keywords, dispositive order status)
- Supreme Court: 88+ pages of results
- Court of Criminal Appeals: 1,035+ pages of results (extensive archive)

**Structure**: The site is a comprehensive statewide portal serving multiple courts:
- Supreme Court (civil appeals)
- Court of Appeals (3 sections: Eastern, Middle, Western)
- Court of Criminal Appeals (criminal appeals - 12 judges)
- Workers' Compensation Appeals
- Trial courts (Circuit, Criminal, Chancery, General Sessions, Juvenile & Family, Municipal)

**Additional Content**:
- Oral argument dockets and videos for all appellate courts
- Public case records search
- Court rules and administrative orders
- Judge biographies
- Court forms and self-help resources
- E-filing system
- RSS feeds for opinions and news
- Press releases and feature stories
- Pending case reports
- Discretionary appeals lists

**Technical**: Drupal-based CMS, no JavaScript required for content access, well-structured HTML with clear data patterns. No public API discovered.

**No Existing Scraper**: No juriscraper coverage found for Tennessee Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, or Court of Criminal Appeals. This represents an excellent opportunity for scraper development given the high-quality, accessible data.

**Note**: The Court of Criminal Appeals has a particularly extensive archive with 1,035+ pages of opinions, making it a high-value target for scraping.
