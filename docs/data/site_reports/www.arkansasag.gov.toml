Opinions cover various topics including:
- Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) issues
- School district matters
- Interlocal cooperation agreements
- General government operations

summary = """
The Arkansas AG website provides access to Attorney General opinions through
a search interface embedded in an iframe. The interface supports multiple
search modes (full text, requester, opinion number, year, recent).

Key findings:
- Public access, no authentication required
- Search interface embedded in iframe (requires JavaScript)
- PDF files hosted on AWS S3 with predictable URLs
- Opinion numbering: YYYY-NNN format
- Both HTML and PDF versions available (when available)
- Recent opinions displayed on home page with metadata
- 10-second crawl delay in robots.txt
- No existing scraper for arkag court_id

URL patterns:
- Search page: /divisions/opinions-foia/attorney-general-opinions-search/
- PDF files: https://ag-opinions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/{opinion-number}.pdf

The iframe-based search interface makes direct scraping more complex, but
the predictable S3 URL pattern for PDFs could be leveraged if opinion numbers
can be enumerated or discovered.
"""

priority = "medium"
priority_reasoning = """
Medium priority because:
- Public access with no barriers
- No existing scraper for this court_id
- Opinions available in searchable format
- Predictable PDF URLs on S3 could simplify scraping
- However, search interface requires JavaScript and is iframe-based
- Would need to either interact with iframe or discover opinion numbers through other means
- 10-second crawl delay is reasonable but slower than some sites
- Unclear how to enumerate all opinions without performing searches
"""

complexity = "moderate"
complexity_reasoning = """
Moderate complexity because:
- Requires JavaScript rendering for search interface
- Search embedded in iframe adds complexity
- Need to interact with search form or discover API endpoints
- PDF URLs are predictable but require knowing opinion numbers
- Could potentially scrape recent opinions from home page
- Could potentially enumerate opinion numbers if pattern is consistent
- Multiple search modes available but all require iframe interaction
- No obvious listing/browse interface for all opinions
- AWS S3 hosting for PDFs is straightforward once URLs are known
