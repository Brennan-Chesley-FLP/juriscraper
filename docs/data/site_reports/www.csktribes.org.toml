[research_notes]
summary = """
The www.csktribes.org website (redirects to cskt.org) is the official website of the Confederated Salish & Kootenai Tribes. It is a WordPress-based site using the FileBird plugin for file management.

IMPORTANT FINDING: The appellate court page DOES provide public access to opinions!

The 'Court Forms & Filings' section at https://cskt.org/appellate-court/ contains a file browser with multiple folders:
- Civil Opinions: 84+ PDF files available (showing 1-10 of 84 with pagination)
- Criminal Opinions: Separate folder (count not determined)
- Dismissals: Separate folder
- ProSe: Separate folder
- Rules of Appellate Procedure: Separate folder

Technical Implementation:
The site uses WordPress FileBird plugin with JSON API endpoints that could be leveraged for scraping:
- POST https://cskt.org/wp-json/filebird/v1/get-attachments (retrieves file listings)
- GET https://cskt.org/wp-json/filebird/v1/get-dl-folders (gets folder structure)

Opinion PDFs follow the pattern: https://cskt.org/wp-content/uploads/YYYY/MM/filename.pdf
Examples show files from 2001, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2010, and 2024.

The site requires JavaScript to render the FileBird file browser interface, but the underlying API endpoints return JSON and could be accessed directly.

This is a tribal appellate court, which represents relatively rare coverage in juriscraper. The availability of 20+ years of opinions makes this a valuable addition.
"""
priority = "medium"
priority_reasoning = "Public access to tribal appellate opinions is available (which are rare in existing coverage). The FileBird API provides structured access. However, volume is likely lower than state courts, and the file organization by type rather than chronologically may complicate scraping. The tribal court nature and historical depth (2001-present) increase value."
complexity = "moderate"
complexity_reasoning = "Requires API interaction with WordPress FileBird endpoints to discover and retrieve files. The file browser requires JavaScript but the underlying JSON API is accessible. Would need to: (1) Query the FileBird API to get folder IDs, (2) Iterate through folders to get file listings with pagination, (3) Download PDFs from wp-content/uploads URLs. File naming conventions are inconsistent which may complicate metadata extraction."
