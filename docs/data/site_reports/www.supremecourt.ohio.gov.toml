Ohio hosts all state appellate court opinions on a single centralized database run by
the Supreme Court's Reporter of Decisions office. Each court is assigned a "Source" index:
- 0: Supreme Court of Ohio
- 1-12: First through Twelfth District Courts of Appeals
- 13: Court of Claims
- 14: Miscellaneous
- 15: All Sources
- 16: All District Courts

The site uses standard HTML forms with ASP.NET ViewState. The scraper sets a `court_index`
parameter to select which court to scrape.

For Courts of Appeals cases, the county field indicates the originating county, which is
important for disambiguating docket numbers that may repeat across districts.

The site has detailed help documentation explaining each search field.

summary = """
The Ohio Supreme Court operates a centralized opinion database (Reporter of Decisions)
serving all appellate courts in Ohio. The system is well-organized with comprehensive
search functionality.

Key findings:
1. Robots.txt allows scraping (only blocks /cms/ and /Content/ODCMB/)
2. Existing scrapers functional and well-maintained since 2014
3. Clean HTML forms without complex JavaScript requirements
4. Comprehensive search with multiple filter options
5. Opinions available in PDF format
6. Coverage from 1992 to present
7. Single unified database for all appellate courts

The existing scraper in juriscraper/opinions/united_states.state/ohio.py uses POST
requests with standard form parameters. Each court-specific scraper (ohioctcl, ohioctapp*)
inherits from ohio.Site and just sets a different court_index parameter.

The site's comment from 2015 says "their site used to be great, but now it's terribly
frustrating" and they had to remove selenium, but the current implementation appears to
work well without it.

Priority: LOW - Existing scrapers are functional and the site is well-designed for scraping.
