summary = """
www.flcourts.org (redirects to www.flcourts.gov) is Florida's statewide courts information portal, NOT a direct source of District Court of Appeal opinions. Built with Next.js/React, it provides information about court structure, services, family law forms, and news. The site references ACIS (Appellate Case Information System) for accessing appellate court dockets and documents from the Florida Supreme Court and all six DCAs, but ACIS appears to be a separate application/portal requiring independent research. Individual DCAs also have their own subdomains (e.g., 6dca.flcourts.gov) that may host opinions directly. The court_id 'fladistctapp' in courts.toml lists this URL, but this is misleading - this domain is the statewide portal, not the actual opinion source. Scraping efforts should focus on: (1) ACIS system, (2) Individual DCA subdomains, or (3) API discovery from the actual opinion-hosting sites.
