West Virginia Judiciary operates a modern, well-organized Drupal-based website.

Key features:
- Supreme Court of Appeals: 17,662 opinions from 1991-present
- Intermediate Court of Appeals: 1,184 opinions from 2022-present (new court)
- Searchable/filterable tables for both courts
- PDF downloads for all opinions
- Current dockets for both appellate courts
- Argument webcasts (live and archived)
- Court information organized by county
- Business Court Division with case search

The site uses static HTML tables (JavaScript for interactivity but not required for data access).
Existing juriscraper coverage includes both Supreme Court and ICA, using the "prior-terms" pages.

The site structure is clean, consistent, and well-maintained. No authentication or payment required.
