**CRITICAL FINDING: Website does not exist**

The domain www.scjc.state.tx.us does not resolve via DNS. Multiple attempts were made:
- https://www.scjc.state.tx.us/
- https://scjc.state.tx.us/
- http://www.scjc.state.tx.us/
- http://scjc.state.tx.us/

All attempts resulted in ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED.

**Next Steps Required:**
1. Research whether the Texas Special Court of Review is still an active court
2. Search for alternate URLs or hosting locations
3. Check if records are hosted on the main Texas courts website (www.txcourts.gov)
4. Verify if this court was dissolved or merged with another court
5. Update courts.toml with correct URL if found, or mark as inactive

**Background Research Needed:**
- What is the Texas Special Court of Review?
- When was it established?
- Is it still operational as of 2026?
- Where are its opinions/records published?

Without access to web search tools, I cannot determine if this court is defunct or if the URL
is simply incorrect in the courts.toml file.
