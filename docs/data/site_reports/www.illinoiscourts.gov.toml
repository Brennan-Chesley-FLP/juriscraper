summary = """
The Illinois Courts website (www.illinoiscourts.gov) provides comprehensive access to both Supreme Court and Appellate Court opinions and oral arguments. The site has a clean, modern design with good search functionality. All content is publicly accessible without authentication. The site uses standard HTML with server-side rendering - no JavaScript rendering required. Opinions are available as PDFs with standardized Illinois citations. RSS feeds are available for automated tracking of new opinions and oral arguments.

Existing scrapers cover both opinions and oral arguments for the Supreme Court and all five Appellate Court districts plus Workers' Compensation. The scrapers were last updated in 2021-2022 to accommodate a redesign of the website.

Note: The original task URL (www.state.il.us) redirects through www.illinois.gov to the actual court site at www.illinoiscourts.gov.
