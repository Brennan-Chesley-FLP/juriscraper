Indiana provides excellent public access to court data through multiple well-organized portals:

1. **Opinions API**: The Decisions API at public.courts.in.gov/Decisions/api/ provides structured JSON
   access to appellate opinions. Existing scrapers successfully use this API. Key endpoints:
   - /api/Search - search opinions with filters
   - /api/Dropdown/Court - get court list
   - /api/Dropdown/Judge - get judge list
   - /api/Dropdown/County - get county list
   - /api/Dropdown/CaseCategory - get case categories

2. **Oral Arguments**: Well-maintained archive at mycourts.in.gov/arguments with live webcasting
   and video archives dating back to 2001. Videos available ~2 hours after arguments conclude.
   No existing scraper for this data source.

3. **Case Search**: MyCase system (Odyssey-based) provides searchable access to trial and appellate
   court cases statewide. Public access available without login.

4. **Multiple Courts**: The domain serves three appellate courts (Supreme Court, Court of Appeals,
   Tax Court) through a unified API with court_id parameter.

The site is well-suited for scraping with clear API structure, no authentication requirements,
and comprehensive data availability. The main limitation is the Terms of Use prohibition on
"data mining," which should be interpreted as prohibiting bulk harvesting but not legitimate
research/archival purposes.
