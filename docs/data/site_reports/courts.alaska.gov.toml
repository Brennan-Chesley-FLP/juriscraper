summary = """
Alaska's appellate courts use a custom case management system at appellate-records.courts.alaska.gov
for opinions and case search. The main courts.alaska.gov site is static HTML with good navigation.

Existing scrapers cover:
- Alaska Supreme Court opinions (alaska.py) - since 2010
- Court of Appeals opinions (alaskactapp.py) - since 1996
- Supreme Court published orders (alaska_slip.py) - since 2000

All three scrapers use the same CMS endpoint structure and share common code. The site has
known reliability issues (frequent encoding errors) but scrapers handle this gracefully.

Oral arguments are available for Supreme Court via third-party streaming (Gavel Alaska/KTOO)
with archives. Court of Appeals arguments are live-streamed only without archives.

The site provides email notifications for new opinions via a listserv, and all historical
opinions back to 1960 are available via Westlaw Alaska Case Law Service.

Existing scrapers provide good coverage of the primary content (opinions). The known technical
issues (user-agent blocking, encoding errors) are already handled. Oral arguments for Supreme
Court would require scraping a third-party site (Gavel Alaska), and Court of Appeals arguments
are not archived.
