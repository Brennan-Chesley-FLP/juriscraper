summary = """
The Maine Judicial Branch website provides comprehensive access to Supreme Judicial Court
opinions dating back to 1997, with well-structured HTML tables and PDF documents. The site
has an existing working scraper for opinions. The site is currently implementing Maine
eCourts (Tyler Odyssey system) which provides electronic filing and case management, though
this is being rolled out in phases by region and case type.

Oral arguments are available as YouTube recordings since January 2024, which could be
cataloged but the actual video files would need to be accessed via YouTube's platform.

The site does not have a robots.txt file and appears to allow scraping. The site is
primarily static HTML with some JavaScript enhancements, making it straightforward to scrape.

The existing scraper appears to be functioning well for Supreme Court opinions. Potential
future work could include:
1. Adding oral argument metadata scraper (linking to YouTube recordings)
2. Exploring Maine eCourts API/portal for docket data (though access is governed by MRECS)
3. Adding Superior Court opinion scraper (mesuperct.py already exists)
"""

priority = "low"
priority_reasoning = """
Existing scraper covers the primary content (Supreme Court opinions) and appears to be
functioning. Oral arguments are available but stored on YouTube rather than directly on the
court site. Docket data is behind the Maine eCourts system which likely requires
authentication and is governed by specific access rules.
"""

complexity = "simple"
complexity_reasoning = """
The opinions page uses simple HTML tables that are easy to parse. The existing scraper
demonstrates this straightforward structure. No JavaScript rendering required, no authentication
needed for opinions, and clear URL patterns.
