summary = """
The Michigan court system provides a well-structured public portal at courts.michigan.gov
serving the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, and Court of Claims with a unified search
and opinion distribution system.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Existing Coverage**: Working scrapers exist for both Supreme Court (mich) and
   Court of Appeals (michctapp) using the JSON API successfully.

2. **API Architecture**: Clean JSON API at /api/CaseSearch/SearchCaseOpinions with
   pagination, filtering by date/court/search terms, and returns structured data
   including opinion metadata, lower court info, and PDF URLs.

3. **Bulk Downloads**: ZIP files available for recent opinions with rolling retention:
   - COA opinions: 28 days (published/unpublished/all/advance sheets)
   - MSC opinions: 90 days
   - MSC orders: 28 days
   - Business Court: monthly

4. **Oral Arguments**: Excellent coverage via live streaming and YouTube archives for
   all three appellate courts. Could be target for future scraper development.

5. **Search Capabilities**: Robust advanced search with filters for case number, parties,
   attorneys, judges, case types, courts, and date ranges.

6. **Known Issues**:
   - Site blocks default user agents (scrapers must use empty User-Agent header)
   - Some API responses have malformed titles requiring secondary lookups
   - Terms of service prohibit bulk commercial downloads

7. **robots.txt**: Allows all scraping (User-agent: * Disallow:)

**Recommendations:**
- Existing opinion scrapers are functional - no immediate action needed
- Consider oral argument scraper using YouTube API for archived videos
- Monitor for changes to user-agent blocking behavior
- Future work: docket/case detail scraping via case search functionality
