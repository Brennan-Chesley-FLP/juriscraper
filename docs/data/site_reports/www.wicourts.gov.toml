# Free-form notes from the research process
summary = """
Wisconsin Court System has a well-organized public website with comprehensive coverage of Supreme Court and Court of Appeals opinions dating back to 1995. The site uses static HTML with some jQuery, making it straightforward to scrape.

Key findings:
1. Existing scrapers already cover both courts (wis.py for Supreme Court, wisctapp.py for Court of Appeals)
2. Scrapers use date-range-based queries to search endpoints (scopin.jsp and caopin.jsp)
3. Opinions are provided as PDFs
4. The site has good search functionality with multiple criteria
5. RSS feeds are available for updates
6. Oral arguments are available but not currently scraped
7. Separate portals (WCCA and WSCCA) provide docket and case information
8. No robots.txt restrictions

The existing opinion scrapers appear to be working well. Potential enhancements:
- Add oral arguments scraper
- Consider scraping WSCCA/WCCA for docket data
- Add scraper for administrative orders and other document types

priority = "low"
