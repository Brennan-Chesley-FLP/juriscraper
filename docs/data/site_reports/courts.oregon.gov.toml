summary = """
Oregon courts have excellent existing coverage via ContentDM API scrapers for all three courts (Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Tax Court). The scrapers were updated in 2023 and include sophisticated features like lower court extraction and citation parsing.

The site also has a Tyler/Thomson Reuters public portal for case/docket access, but this is primarily for current case management and eFiling. Document access requires registration or OJCIN subscription.

Key technical infrastructure:
1. Main site: courts.oregon.gov (SharePoint/Tyler Tech)
2. Opinion delivery: ContentDM API (cdm17027.contentdm.oclc.org)
3. Case management: Tyler portal (trportal.courts.oregon.gov)
4. Subscription service: OJCIN OnLine (enhanced document access)

The existing scrapers appear to be working well and are actively maintained. No major issues or gaps identified.
