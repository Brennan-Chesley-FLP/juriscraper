Supreme Court opinions available via JSON API at https://opinions.courts.state.wy.us/Home/GetOpinions
The API accepts StartDate and EndDate parameters (format: MM/DD/YYYY). Without parameters, returns entire dataset.
Opinions are searchable by date range, appellant name, and appellee name.
The website notes: "Opinions and orders published prior to 2006 are not available in this search."
PDFs are hosted at https://documents.courts.state.wy.us/Opinions/
Each opinion includes: OpinionID (citation like "2026 WY 5"), PublishDate, Appellant, Appellee, DocketNumber, and DocumentName (PDF filename).
Existing scraper uses this API and has been maintained since 2014 with multiple updates.

summary = """
Wyoming's judicial branch has a modern, well-designed website built on WordPress.
The site recently underwent a redesign and is actively maintained.

Key findings:
- Excellent JSON API at opinions.courts.state.wy.us/Home/GetOpinions
- API accepts date range parameters for targeted scraping
- Opinions available from 2006 onwards
- Clean data structure: OpinionID, dates, parties, docket numbers, document URLs
- PDFs hosted on separate subdomain (documents.courts.state.wy.us)
- Existing scraper is modern and well-maintained (updated 2024)
- Site has custom bot protection for search but allows opinion scraping
- robots.txt blocks search abuse but permits normal crawling
- Oral arguments are mentioned but archive accessibility unclear
- Chancery Court has separate orders/decisions section

The existing scraper (wyo.py) is excellent:
- Uses the JSON API directly
- Supports backscraping with date ranges
- Extracts lower court info from opinion text
- Well-documented history of updates (2014, 2015, 2016, 2024)
- No known issues

Domain redirect note: www.courts.state.wy.us → www.wyocourts.gov
API and document subdomains use the old courts.state.wy.us domain.
"""
priority = "low"
priority_reasoning = """
Existing scraper is modern, uses the API, and appears to work well.
No updates needed unless:
1. API endpoint changes
2. Oral argument archiving becomes available and needs scraping
3. Chancery Court orders become a priority
The site is well-maintained and provides excellent public access via API.

complexity = "simple"
complexity_reasoning = """
- JSON API with clean structure
- No authentication required
- Straightforward date range parameters
- Direct PDF links
- Existing scraper demonstrates simplicity
- robots.txt allows scraping of opinion content
Main complexity is handling the domain redirect and multiple subdomains.
