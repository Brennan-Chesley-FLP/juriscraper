summary = """
The Maryland Attorney General's office provides a comprehensive searchable database of
AG opinions going back to 1916. The site is built on Microsoft SharePoint and uses a
SharePoint REST API to fetch opinion metadata. An existing scraper successfully handles
this site using the discovered API endpoint.

The API endpoint: `https://oag.maryland.gov/resources-info/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('Search-Opinions')/items`
accepts OData query parameters like `$top`, `$select`, and `$orderby`.

PDF documents are stored in a predictable URL pattern:
`https://oag.maryland.gov/resources-info/Documents/pdfs/Opinions/{year}/{attachment}.pdf`

The site requires JavaScript to function (SharePoint framework), but the API can be
accessed directly without JavaScript. The existing scraper uses the API with special
headers: `Accept: application/json;odata=verbose`.

Note: The task indicated the domain as "www.oag.state.md.us" but the actual working
domain is "oag.maryland.gov". The www.oag.state.md.us domain appears to be
inaccessible or has been deprecated.
